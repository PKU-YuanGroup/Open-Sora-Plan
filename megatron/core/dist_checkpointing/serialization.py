""" Entrypoints for saving and loading the distributed checkpoints.

Functions `load` and `save` are equivalents of `torch.load` and `torch.save`
but expect torch.Tensors to be wrapped with classes from the `mapping module`.
Additionally, `load` expects the sharded state dict argument as a guidance for loading the sharded tensors.
