## 💪 Goal
This project aims to create a simple and scalable repo, to reproduce [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) (OpenAI, but we prefer to call it "ClosedAI" ) and build knowledge about Video-VQVAE (VideoGPT) + DiT at scale. However, since we have limited resources, we deeply wish all open-source community can contribute to this project. Pull requests are welcome!!!

本项目希望通过开源社区的力量复现Sora，由北大-兔展AIGC联合实验室共同发起，当前我们资源有限仅搭建了基础架构，无法进行完整训练，希望通过开源社区逐步增加模块并筹集资源进行训练，当前版本离目标差距巨大，仍需持续完善和快速迭代，欢迎Pull request！！！

Project stages:
- Primary
1. Setup the codebase and train a un-conditional model on a landscape dataset.
2. Train models that boost resolution and duration.

- Extensions
3. Conduct text2video experiments on landscape dataset.
4. Train the 1080p model on video2text dataset.
5. Control model with more conditions.

## 📰 News

**[2024.03.27]** 🚀🚀🚀 We release the report of [VideoCausalVAE](docs/CausalVideoVAE.md), which supports both images and videos. We present our reconstructed video in this demonstration as follows. The text-to-video model is on the way.

https://github.com/qqingzheng/Open-Sora-Plan/assets/88202804/0dbf8f8f-efba-414e-ad42-1f839839f9cf


**[2024.03.10]** 🚀🚀🚀 This repo supports training a latent size of 225×90×90 (t×h×w), which means we are able to **train 1 minute of 1080P video with 30FPS** (2× interpolated frames and 2× super resolution) under class-condition.

**[2024.03.08]** We support the training code of text condition with 16 frames of 512x512. The code is mainly borrowed from [Latte](https://github.com/Vchitect/Latte).

**[2024.03.07]** We support training with 128 frames (when sample rate = 3, which is about 13 seconds) of 256x256, or 64 frames (which is about 6 seconds) of 512x512.

**[2024.03.05]** See our latest [todo](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan?tab=readme-ov-file#todo), pull requests are welcome.

**[2024.03.04]** We re-organizes and modulizes our code to make it easy to [contribute](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute-to-the-open-sora-plan-community) to the project, to contribute please see the [Repo structure](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan?tab=readme-ov-file#repo-structure).

**[2024.03.03]** We opened some [discussions](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan/discussions) to clarify several issues.

**[2024.03.01]** Training code is available now! Learn more on our [project page](https://pku-yuangroup.github.io/Open-Sora-Plan/). Please feel free to watch 👀 this repository for the latest updates.

## 🚀 Improved Training Performance

In comparison to the original implementation, we implement a selection of training speed acceleration and memory saving features including gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, and pre-extracted features, xformers, deepspeed. Some data points using **a batch size of 1 with a A100**:
