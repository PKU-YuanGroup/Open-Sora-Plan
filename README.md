<h1 align="left"> <a href="">Open-Sora Plan</a></h1>

This project aims to create a simple and scalable repo, to reproduce [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) (OpenAI, but we prefer to call it "ClosedAI" ). We wish the open-source community can contribute to this project. Pull requests are welcome! The current code supports complete training and inference using the Huawei Ascend AI computing system. Models trained on Huawei Ascend can also output video quality comparable to industry standards.

本项目希望通过开源社区的力量复现Sora，由北大-兔展AIGC联合实验室共同发起，当前版本离目标差距仍然较大，仍需持续完善和快速迭代，欢迎Pull request！目前代码同时支持使用国产AI计算系统（华为昇腾）进行完整的训练和推理。基于昇腾训练出的模型，也可输出持平业界的视频质量。

# 😮 Highlights

Open-Sora Plan shows excellent performance in video generation.

### 🔥 High performance CausalVideoVAE, but with fewer training cost
- High compression ratio with excellent performance, capable of **compressing videos by 256 times (4×8×8)**. Causal convolution supports simultaneous inference of images and videos but only need **1 node to train**.

### 🚀 Video Diffusion Model based on 3D attention, joint learning of spatiotemporal features.
- With a **3D full attention architecture** instead of a 2+1D model, 3D attention can better capture joint spatial and temporal features.

# 🗝️ Training & Validating

## 🗜️ CausalVideoVAE

### Data prepare
The organization of the training data is easy. We only need to put all the videos recursively in a directory. This makes the training more convenient when using multiple datasets.
``` shell
Training Dataset
|——sub_dataset1
    |——sub_sub_dataset1
        |——video1.mp4
        |——video2.mp4
        ......
    |——sub_sub_dataset2
        |——video3.mp4
        |——video4.mp4
        ......
|——sub_dataset2
    |——video5.mp4
    |——video6.mp4
    ......
|——video7.mp4
|——video8.mp4
```
### Training
``` shell
bash scripts/causalvae/train.sh

## 📜 Text-to-Video 

### Data prepare
We use a `data.txt` file to specify all the training data. Each line in the file consists of `DATA_ROOT` and `DATA_JSON`. The example of `data.txt` is as follows.
```
/path/to/data_root_1,/path/to/data_json_1.json
/path/to/data_root_2,/path/to/data_json_2.json
...
```
Then, we introduce the format of the annotation json file. The absolute data path is the concatenation of `DATA_ROOT` and the `"path"` field in the annotation json file.
#### For image
The format of image annotation file is as follows.
```
[
  {
    "path": "00168/001680102.jpg",
    "cap": [
      "xxxxx."
    ],
    "resolution": {
      "height": 512,
      "width": 683
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

#### For video
The format of video annotation file is as follows. More details refer to [HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0).
```
[
  {
    "path": "panda70m_part_5565/qLqjjDhhD5Q/qLqjjDhhD5Q_segment_0.mp4",
    "cap": [
      "A man and a woman are sitting down on a news anchor talking to each other."
    ],
    "resolution": {
      "height": 720,
      "width": 1280
    },
    "fps": 29.97002997002997,
    "duration": 11.444767
  },
  ...
]
```

### Training
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/train_t2v.sh
```

We introduce some key parameters in order to customize your training process.

| Argparse | Usage |
|:---|:---|
|_Training size_||
|`--num_frames 61`|To train videos of different durations, e.g, 29, 61, 93, 125...|
|`--max_height 640`|To train videos of different resolutions|
|`--max_width 480`|To train videos of different resolutions|
|_Data processing_||
|`--data /path/to/data.txt`|Specify your training data.|
|`--speed_factor 1.25`|To accelerate 1.25x videos. |
|`--drop_short_ratio 1.0`|Do not want to train on videos of dynamic durations, discard all video data with frame counts not equal to `--num_frames`|
|`--group_frame`|If you want to train with videos of dynamic durations, we highly recommend specifying `--group_frame` as well. It improves computational efficiency during training.|
|_Multi-stage transfer learning_||
|`--interpolation_scale_h 1.0`|When training a base model, such as 240p (`--max_height 240`, `--interpolation_scale_h 1.0`) , and you want to initialize higher resolution models like 480p (height 480) from 240p's weights, you need to adjust `--max_height 480`, `--interpolation_scale_h 2.0`, and set `--pretrained` to your 240p weights path (path/to/240p/xxx.safetensors).|
|`--interpolation_scale_w 1.0`|Same as `--interpolation_scale_h 1.0`|
|_Load weights_||
|`--pretrained`|This is typically used for loading pretrained weights across stages, such as using 240p weights to initialize 480p training. Or when switching datasets and you do not want the previous optimizer state.|
|`--resume_from_checkpoint`|It will resume the training process from the latest checkpoint in `--output_dir`. Typically, we set `--resume_from_checkpoint="latest"`, which is useful in cases of unexpected interruptions during training.|
|_Sequence Parallelism_||
|`--sp_size 8 --train_sp_batch_size 2`|It means running a batch size of 2 across 8 GPUs (8 GPUs on the same node).|

> [!Warning]
> <div align="left">
> <b>
> 🚨 We have two ways to load weights: `--pretrained` and `--resume_from_checkpoint`. The latter will override the former.
> </b>
> </div>

### Inference

We provide multiple inference scripts to support various requirements. We recommend configuration `--guidance_scale 7.5 --num_sampling_steps 100 --sample_method EulerAncestralDiscrete` for sampling.

**Inference on 93×720p**, we report speed on H100.

| Size | 1 GPU | 8 GPUs (sp) | 
|---|---|---|
|29×720p|420s/100step|80s/100step|
|93×720p|3400s/100step|450s/100step|

#### 🖥️ 1 GPU 
If you only have one GPU, it will perform inference on each sample sequentially, one at a time.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_t2v.sh
```

#### 🖥️🖥️ Multi-GPUs 
If you want to batch infer a large number of samples, each GPU will infer one sample.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_t2v_ddp.sh
```

#### 🖥️🖥️ Multi-GPUs & Sequence Parallelism 
If you want to quickly infer one sample, it will utilize all GPUs simultaneously to infer that sample.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_t2v_sp.sh
```

## 🖼️ Image-to-Video

### Data prepare
Same as Text-to-Video.

### Training
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/train_inpaint.sh
```

In addition to the parameters shared with the Text-to-Video mode, there are some unique parameters specific to the Image-to-Video mode that you need to be aware of.

| Argparse          | Usage                                                        |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Training size_   |                                                              |
| `--use_vae_preprocessed_mask` | Whether to use VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to encode the mask in order to achieve frame-level mask alignment. |
| _Data processing_ |                                                              |
| `--i2v_ratio 0.5` | The proportion of training data allocated to executing the Image-to-Video task. |
| `--transition_ratio 0.4 ` | The proportion of training data allocated to executing the transition task. |
| ` --v2v_ratio 0.1 ` | The proportion of training data allocated to executing the video continuation task. |
| `--default_text_ratio 0.5` | When training with CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) enabled, a portion of the text is replaced with default text, while another portion is set to an empty string. |
| _Load weights_ |  |
| `--pretrained_transformer_model_path ` | This parameter functions the same as the `--pretrained` parameter. |

### Inference

In the current version, we have only open-sourced the 480p version of the Image-to-Video (I2V) model. We recommend configuration `--guidance_scale 7.5 --num_sampling_steps 100 --sample_method PNDM` for sampling. Please note that due to the addition of frame-controllable fine-tuning, using the other samplers may not yield satisfactory results.

**Inference on 93×480p**, we report speed on H100.

| Size    | 1 GPU        | 8 GPUs (sp) |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 93×480p | 427s/100step | 81s/100step |

Before inference, you need to create two text files: one named `prompt.txt` and another named `conditional_images_path.txt`. Each line of text in `prompt.txt` should correspond to the paths on each line in `conditional_images_path.txt`. 

For example, if the content of `prompt.txt` is:

```
this is a prompt of i2v task.
this is a prompt of transition task.
```

Then the content of conditional_images_path should be:

```
/path/to/image_0.png
/path/to/image_1_0.png,/path/to/image_1_1.png
```

This means we will execute a image-to-video task using `/path/to/image_0.png` and "this is a prompt of i2v task." For the transition task, we'll use `/path/to/image_1_0.png` and `/path/to/image_1_1.png` (note that these two paths are separated by a comma without any spaces) along with "this is a prompt of transition task."

After creating the files, make sure to specify their paths in the `sample_inpaint.sh` script.

#### 🖥️ 1 GPU 

If you only have one GPU, it will perform inference on each sample sequentially, one at a time.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_inpaint.sh
```
#### 🖥️🖥️ Multi-GPUs 
If you want to batch infer a large number of samples, each GPU will infer one sample.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_inpaint_ddp.sh
```

#### 🖥️🖥️ Multi-GPUs & Sequence Parallelism 
If you want to quickly infer one sample, it will utilize all GPUs simultaneously to infer that sample.
```
bash scripts/text_condition/gpu/sample_inpaint_sp.sh
```
