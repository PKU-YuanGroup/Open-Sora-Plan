an intense scene unfolds on the streets of San Francisco, where bursts of orange muzzle flashes cut through the gray smoke billowing in the air. Armed police officers take cover behind their black and white patrol cars, exchanging fire with sharply dressed individuals, suspected members of the mafia, wielding shiny pistols. The chaos is concentrated on a street lined with historic red-brick buildings, their windows reflecting the glaring emergency lights of police vehicles. Nearby, discarded bullet casings glint on the asphalt, evidence of the fierce battle taking place.
