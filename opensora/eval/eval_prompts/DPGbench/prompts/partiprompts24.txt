A surreal landscape where the iconic skyline of downtown Manhattan, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, is juxtaposed against the majestic backdrop of Mount Everest, its peak shrouded in snow and clouds. In the foreground, the ancient Great Pyramid of Giza stands solitary, its limestone blocks weathered to a golden hue, casting a long shadow in the direction of the urban architecture. This unusual combination of human-made wonders spans different continents and eras, creating a striking and imaginative scene.
