A quaint scene unfolds on a polished wooden table, drenched in the warm glow of the afternoon sun, where a quintet of deep purple, woven baskets with a round shape is meticulously arranged. Each basket cradles a square, rich crimson wallet that stands out against the violet hues. Delicate shadows cast by the baskets and wallets dance upon the table, accentuating their colors and contours in the sunlight.
