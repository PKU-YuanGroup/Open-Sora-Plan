On a sandy beach, a person stands clad in colorful board shorts beside a bright yellow umbrella that's anchored into the sand. Near them, another individual relaxes in a navy blue beach chair, enjoying the shade provided by the large umbrella. The first person is also standing close to the other, indicating companionship as they both appear to be enjoying their beachside retreat.
