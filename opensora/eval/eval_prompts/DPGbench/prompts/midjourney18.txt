An intricately detailed representation of the Marvel character Ghost Rider featuring a human skull, with flames licking around the contours of the skull and rising above it in a fierce expression of fiery vengeance. The skull, alight with bright orange and yellow tones, dominates the image with its full head in view, set against a stark, void-like background that accentuates its fierceness. The character concept art captures both the macabre essence and supernatural intensity of the spectral figure.
