In an otherwise silent room, the melodic rhythm of a recorder being played gently reverberates throughout the space. A single lantern with a hexagonal frame and intricate metalwork sits nearby, emitting a soft, warm light that flickers subtly, illuminating the immediate vicinity. The walls, which are painted a muted cream color, catch the lantern's glow, creating a cozy ambiance around the musician.
