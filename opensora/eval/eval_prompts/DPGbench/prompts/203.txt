Inside a bathroom with white tiled walls, a pastel pink toothbrush is propped up next to a towering yellow mop with a fluffy fiber head. Despite their size difference, they both lean casually against the same wall, with the toothbrush appearing diminutive when compared to the mop. The floor is speckled with small water droplets, hinting that the mop may have been recently used.
