An elderly woman with silver hair and glasses sits comfortably in an armchair, a colorful picture book open in her lap. Beside her, a young boy and girl, her grandchildren, listen intently, the boy wearing a green-striped shirt and the girl in a yellow dress. They are surrounded by a cozy room with a plush beige carpet and a small wooden table stacked with more books.
