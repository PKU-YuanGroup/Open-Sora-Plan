a vintage wine bottle with a tapered neck, its label partially peeled off, serving as a makeshift candle holder. A white candle, with wax drippings along the bottle's sides, is firmly stuck in the spout, casting a soft glow. The bottle is set upon a rustic wooden table, surrounded by a scattering of wax remnants and a few scattered wine glasses.
