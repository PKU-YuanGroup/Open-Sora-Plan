A dilapidated spaceship, covered in patches of rust and with peeling paint, is depicted in the midst of a powerful blast-off, leaving a trail of smoke and fire behind. In the distance, a sprawling cityscape with towering skyscrapers stretches towards the horizon, where it meets the calm expanse of the ocean. Beyond the city, a range of majestic mountains rises up, and above it all, a large, dark moon dominates the sky, casting a mysterious glow. The entire scene is rendered in a high-contrast anime style, with sharp lines and dramatic shading that give the illustration a dynamic and intense feel.
