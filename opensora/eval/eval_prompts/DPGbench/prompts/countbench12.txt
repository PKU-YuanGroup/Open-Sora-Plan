A collection of eight elegant side chairs from the 1950s, designed by Gianni Vigorelli, each stands 37 1/2 inches tall. The frames are made from pearwood, featuring a warm, golden-brown hue with a smooth finish that highlights the wood's natural grain. The seats and backrests are upholstered in a sleek, black vinyl, providing a comfortable yet durable seating surface. These chairs measure 16 1/2 inches in width and 17 3/8 inches in depth, making them well-proportioned for a variety of dining spaces.
