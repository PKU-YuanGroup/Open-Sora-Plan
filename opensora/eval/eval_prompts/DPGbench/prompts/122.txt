An old fashioned, metallic fan with a rounded base and rusted blades stands next to an ornate, antique knife with a weathered bone handle. Both items are propped against a timeworn wooden wall that bears the marks of age and the warm, golden hue of the afternoon sunlight filtering through a nearby window. The dust particles in the air catch the light, highlighting the vintage aura of the scene.
