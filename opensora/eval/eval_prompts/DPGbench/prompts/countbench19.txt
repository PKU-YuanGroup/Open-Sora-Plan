Nine differently colored labels, each featuring the iconographic representation of a Central Processing Unit, aligned neatly for visual comparison. These square icons vary in shades from vibrant red to deep blue, with the CPU symbol prominently displayed in the center. The texture of the labels appears smooth, and they are arranged in a grid pattern on a plain, light background that enhances their visibility in the illustration.
