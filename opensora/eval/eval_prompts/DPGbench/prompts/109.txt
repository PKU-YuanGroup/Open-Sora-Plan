Adjacent to each other in a room, a large rectangular bed draped in a navy-blue comforter sits parallel to a square-shaped nightstand with a matte finish. The nightstand holds an angular lamp and a small stack of hardcover books. The two pieces of furniture are positioned on a plush beige carpet that covers the majority of the floor space.
