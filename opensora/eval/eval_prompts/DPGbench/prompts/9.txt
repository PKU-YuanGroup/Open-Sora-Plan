Two richly purple-colored folders resting on a wooden table flooded with warm sunlight. The table's surface reflects a subtle sheen, highlighting the folders' smooth texture and the shadows they cast. Around the folders, the table is mostly clear, save for a silver pen lying diagonally near one of the folders.
