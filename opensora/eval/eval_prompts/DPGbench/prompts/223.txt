Amidst the darkness of a quiet room, illuminated by the ethereal blue light of a holographic display that projects a visualization of cyberspace, sits a sleek cell phone and a modern router/modem on a polished wooden desk. The intricate patterns of the wood grain are faintly visible under the neon glow, which casts soft reflections on the devices' surfaces. The router/modem, with its blinking indicator lights, stands beside the phone, which shows a clock on its screen indicating the late hour.
