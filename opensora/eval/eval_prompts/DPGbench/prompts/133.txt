In the midst of a bustling cityscape under the bright midday sun, a solitary wooden bench with peeling green paint sits empty on the sidewalk. A city worker dressed in a reflective orange vest is actively disinfecting the bench surface, using a clear spray bottle filled with a blue cleaning solution. Passersby continue with their day, navigating around the cleaning activity, while the noise of the city hums in the background.
