An old-fashioned covered wagon with a weathered canvas top and wooden spokes on its wheels is captured from behind. Peeking out from the flap of the canvas, a large polar bear's head emerges, its fur a stark contrast to the beige fabric of the wagon. The wagon itself is parked on a gravel path, surrounded by tufts of grass and small shrubs.
