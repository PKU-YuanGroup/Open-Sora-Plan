A small, vibrant green tree sits snugly within a terracotta pot that features intricate patterns etched into its surface. The pot is placed to the left of a simple white ceramic cup with a delicate handle, both resting on a wooden countertop. To the side of the cup is a chair with a woven seat, and the tree in the pot shares this proximity with the chair as well. Perched precariously on the edge of the chair is a crumpled piece of paper, the handwriting upon it partially visible, creating a tableau of everyday items in close association.
