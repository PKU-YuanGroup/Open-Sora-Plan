A lush green ivy plant with broad leaves, creeping up the side of a weathered red brick wall. The wall has a rough texture, and the plant's tendrils are firmly attached, showcasing the contrast between the organic growth and the man-made structure. Small patches of moss can also be seen interspersed between the bricks, adding to the visual diversity of the scene.
