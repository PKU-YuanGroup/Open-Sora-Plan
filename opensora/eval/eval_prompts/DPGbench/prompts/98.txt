On a polished wooden table, a small circular red earphone rests, its size notably less than that of the rectangular-shaped green tape dispenser placed beside it. The table surface reflects the soft glow of the morning light, accentuating the smooth texture of the earphone's surface and the matte finish of the green tape dispenser. In the background, the grain of the wood can be seen, giving a warm ambiance to the arrangement of objects on the table.
