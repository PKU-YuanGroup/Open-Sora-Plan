A striking dishwasher with a glossy, rainbow-colored exterior stands out in a neatly-arranged kitchen with white marble countertops. Inside the open dishwasher, five stainless steel pots are being methodically cleaned by the powerful water jets. Surrounding the dishwasher are orderly arranged kitchen utensils and a spice rack filled with an assortment of colorful spices in clear glass jars.
