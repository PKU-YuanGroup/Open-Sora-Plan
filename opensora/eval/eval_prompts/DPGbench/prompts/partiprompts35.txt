A dining table is laden with an array of Singaporean dishes, featuring a plate of fragrant chicken rice with golden-brown skin, a bowl of bak chor mee with minced meat and springy noodles, and a steaming bowl of spicy laksa with prawns and fish cakes. The tablecloth is a vibrant red, complementing the colorful dishes, and chopsticks rest beside each bowl. In the background, a pitcher of iced water and glasses are neatly arranged, ready for serving.
