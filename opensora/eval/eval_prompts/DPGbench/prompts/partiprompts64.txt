An aerial view of a coastal French city, captured in a satellite image, reveals a sprawling green park on the western edge, bordered by neatly arranged streets. To the north, a majestic mountain looms over the urban landscape, its peak just touching the edges of a drifting cloud that partially obscures the view. The intricate patterns of the city's layout are visible, with residential areas, winding roads, and the shimmering coastline all distinctly marked from this bird's-eye perspective.
