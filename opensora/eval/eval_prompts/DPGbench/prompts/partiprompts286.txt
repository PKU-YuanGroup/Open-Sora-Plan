A bright yellow, diamond-shaped traffic sign stands out with a black silhouette of a wooly mammoth prominently displayed in its center. The sign's edges are slightly worn, indicating it has withstood the elements over time. It is mounted on a metal pole beside a road that meanders through a grassy area with a few scattered trees.
