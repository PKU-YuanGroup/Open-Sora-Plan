a pristine white yacht floats serenely in the tranquil waters of a secluded bay, its sleek hull reflecting the bright sunshine. The expansive deck is lined with polished wooden railings, and several deck chairs are arranged facing the open water. In the distance, the gentle hills surrounding the bay are dotted with green foliage, providing a picturesque backdrop under the clear blue sky.
