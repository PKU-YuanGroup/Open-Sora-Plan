Two ceramic cups sit side by side on a marble countertop, one featuring an intricate latte art design of the Eiffel Tower, the other boasting a foamy depiction of the Statue of Liberty. Both cups have a glossy finish, with the Eiffel Tower cup having a delicate, pastel blue hue, while the Statue of Liberty cup is a soft shade of pink. The steam rising from the cups suggests the coffee is freshly brewed, and a silver spoon rests beside each cup, positioned on a small, round saucer.
