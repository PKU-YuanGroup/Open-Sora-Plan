A grand, sprawling landscape inspired by the iconic style of Hayao Miyazaki's "Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind" and the "Breath of the Wild" from The Legend of Zelda series. The scene blends the fantastical elements of Studio Ghibli's post-apocalyptic setting with the vibrant, open-world aesthetic found in the game. Towering, ancient trees with twisted roots rise from the earth, while bioluminescent creatures add a touch of surreal luminance, hinting at an adventure awaiting at the edge of the world.
