A tall glass filled with a vibrant red Bloody Mary cocktail, garnished with a green celery stick and a skewered olive. The glass is beaded with condensation and sits on a small white plate beside a folded white napkin. The cocktail is placed on a dark wooden bar counter, illuminated by warm overhead lighting.
