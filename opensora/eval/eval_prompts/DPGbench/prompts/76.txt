In a dimly lit bathroom with off-white tiles, there sits a wooden shelf against the wall, supporting five rolls of toilet paper arranged neatly side by side. Each roll is compact and untouched, displaying a uniform quilted texture. The shelf is positioned above a small waste bin, and to the side, a soft, pale blue towel hangs loosely.
