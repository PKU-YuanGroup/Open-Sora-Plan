A surreal image of a clear glass light bulb adrift in the vast expanse of outer space, its filament replaced by a miniature sailing boat with white sails unfurled. The light bulb, seemingly floating among the stars and nebulae, casts a subtle glow that illuminates the delicate features of the boat within. Surrounding the bulb, the cosmos stretches out in shades of deep blues and purples, speckled with the twinkling of distant stars.
