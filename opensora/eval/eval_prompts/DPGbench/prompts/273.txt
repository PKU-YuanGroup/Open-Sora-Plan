Three white golf balls are precisely placed on the black, moving conveyor of a large treadmill. The golf balls, significantly smaller in scale, appear almost like tiny planets gliding along the treadmill's expansive surface. The ambient light casts a soft glow on the scene, accentuating the contrast between the smooth texture of the golf balls and the textured belt of the treadmill, as the treadmill operates in a room with fading daylight filtering through a nearby window.
