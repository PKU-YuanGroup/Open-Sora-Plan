The imposing structure is centered between the burgeoning greenery that flanks it, under the vast expanse of a midday sky punctuated by towering cumulonimbus clouds. The scene is a study in contrasts, with the stark industrial facade of the station juxtaposed against the whimsical patterns of nature reasserting itself.
