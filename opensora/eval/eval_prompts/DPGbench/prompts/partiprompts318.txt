A solitary tree stands in the midst of a grassy field, its branches reaching out in all directions without a single leaf to be seen. The bark of the tree is a rough, gray texture, contrasting with the vibrant green of the grass. Despite the warm season, the tree's bare limbs give it a stark, sculptural appearance against the clear blue sky.
