a spacious square where a large, weathered stone pedestal stands prominently at the center, devoid of the horse statue that once adorned it. The pedestal's surface is rough and covered with patches of moss, indicating its age and exposure to the elements. Around the base, cobblestones are laid in a pattern that radiates outward, suggesting the importance of the now-absent statue.
