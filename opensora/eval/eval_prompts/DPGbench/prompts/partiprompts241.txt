A living room scene featuring an overturned glass of red wine on a beige fabric couch. The spilled wine has created an accidental pattern on the couch's surface, whimsically resembling the word "OOPS". The couch is positioned next to a small wooden side table, upon which rests an open book and a remote control, untouched by the spill.
