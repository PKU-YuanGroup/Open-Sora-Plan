Five savory pizzas with vibrant red tomato sauce and a generous amount of golden cheese are being baked to perfection inside the warm, rustic brick oven. The oven, radiating heat, has a wooden handle peeking out, suggesting it's an old-fashioned, manually-operated one. The flames at the back cast a flickering glow, highlighting the oven's arch and the earthen tones of the bricks.
