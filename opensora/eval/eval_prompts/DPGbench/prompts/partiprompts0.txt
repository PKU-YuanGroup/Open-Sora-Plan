A cheerful sloth, adorned with a black leather jacket and a brown cowboy hat, stands confidently on a patch of green grass. Its attire is completed with a red tartan kilt and a neatly tied bowtie. In one claw, it grasps a sturdy quarterstaff, while the other holds a large, ancient-looking book. Positioned a short distance behind the sloth, there is a gleaming Volkswagen van, its exterior decorated with vibrant flower patterns. The entire whimsical scene is captured through a wide-angle lens from a low vantage point, emphasizing the sloth's stature and the van's presence.
