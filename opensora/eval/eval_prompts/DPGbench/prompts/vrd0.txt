A bustling urban street teeming with vehicles; in the forefront, a sleek silver sedan with a focused driver at the wheel navigating cautiously. Adjacent to it, a bright red compact car with its driver's side mirror just inches away. Just ahead, a bulky white van looms, its boxy shape dominating the view of the sedan's driver. To the rear, the silver car is trailed by a navy blue hatchback keeping a safe distance, while on the far side, it is flanked by a green coupe, all of them partaking in the steady flow of traffic. Bringing up the rear, a large city bus looms, casting a shadow over the cars ahead, as it waits for the right moment to continue its designated route.
