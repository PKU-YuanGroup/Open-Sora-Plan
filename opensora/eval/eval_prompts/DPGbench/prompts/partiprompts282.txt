a vibrant lavender backpack with a plush triceratops head peeking out from the top, its green eyes and three distinct horns adding a playful touch. The backpack is made of a soft, velvety material and is resting against a pale wooden bench. Around it, there are scattered crayons and a few sheets of paper with childlike drawings.
