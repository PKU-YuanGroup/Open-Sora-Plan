An aged and quaint room, lined with crinkled wallpaper, houses a row of four spherical, silver projectors resting on a weathered shelving unit at the rear. These projectors cast bright, focused beams of light toward the room's center, where an expansive antique oak desk sits solemnly. On the deskâ€™s polished surface, three electronic keyboards, each with a different design and layout, are neatly arranged, waiting to be played.
