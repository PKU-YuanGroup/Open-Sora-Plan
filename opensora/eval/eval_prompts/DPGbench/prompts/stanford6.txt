An almost empty airport tarmac bathed in the soft glow of the early morning sun. A few scattered luggage carts stand idle near the terminal, while two commercial airplanes sit parked on the apron, their boarding stairs down, anticipating the arrival of passengers. In the distance, by the edge of the main airport building, stand two tall poles, painted in alternating bands of red and white, standing out against the clear blue sky.
