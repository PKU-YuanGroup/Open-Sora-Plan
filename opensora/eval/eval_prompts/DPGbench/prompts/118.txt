A tranquil scene where two brown, fibrous coconuts rest on the lush green grass beside a solitary deer, which is lying down, taking a respite. The deer has a rich, brown coat with white spots and appears to be at ease in the natural surroundings. In the background, a few trees with verdant leaves provide a quiet backdrop to this peaceful setting.
