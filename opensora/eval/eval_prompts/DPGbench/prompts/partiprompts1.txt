A vibrant oil painting depicts a glossy, turquoise VW van parked against the backdrop of a bustling city skyline. In the foreground, a contented sloth stands out with its unique attire consisting of a sleek leather jacket, a traditional tartan kilt, and a quirky bowtie, all topped off with a classic cowboy hat. The sloth grips a sturdy quarterstaff in one hand while balancing a large, leather-bound tome in the other, all set upon a lush patch of green grass that contrasts with the urban environment behind it.
