A small, teardrop-shaped candle with a pale blue hue graces the surface of a large, cubic storage box. The box itself features a textured, glossy white finish and sits squarely in the corner of a room. To the side of the box, there's a stack of neatly folded towels in varying shades of beige and cream.
