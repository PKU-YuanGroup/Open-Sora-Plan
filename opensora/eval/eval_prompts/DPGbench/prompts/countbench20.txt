a collection of four vibrantly colored, circular buttons, each featuring a simplistic heart icon with a prominent plus sign at its center, signaling the option to add to favorites. These flat-designed icons are isolated against a clean background, making them immediately identifiable for user interface purposes. Each button presents a different hue: one is red, another blue, the third one is a sunny yellow, and the last one is green, creating a visually appealing and intuitive set for users to interact with.
