Under the soft glow of a rising sun, a round jade-colored table supports six freshly steamed baozi, their white wrappers slightly translucent, emitting tender wisps of steam. Neatly accompanying them are four ice cream cones, each boasting a different, vivid hue, ranging from the deep purple of blackberry to the cheerful yellow of mango. The morning light accentuates the contrast between the warm fog lifting from the baozi and the frosty sheen on the scoops of ice cream.
