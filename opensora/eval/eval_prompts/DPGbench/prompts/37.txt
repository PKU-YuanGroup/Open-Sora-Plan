In the dimly lit interior of a spacious wardrobe, a neat row of five hangers stands out, each one a different brilliant hueâ€”ranging from a deep royal blue to a bright lemon yellow. They are spaced evenly apart, casting soft shadows against the dark wooden back of the closet. The smooth, plastic texture of the hangers contrasts with the rough texture of the wardrobe's interior, and their curved shapes seem almost to beckon items of clothing to drape over them.
