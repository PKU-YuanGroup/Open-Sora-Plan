Sitting at one end of a wooden park bench, the perspective is directed upwards towards a clear blue sky with a few fluffy clouds drifting by. In the expanse of the sky, the inspirational phrase 'imagine the outcome' appears, almost as if written by an airplane's smoke trail. The bench, with its weathered slats and cast-iron arms, provides a tranquil spot for contemplation within the grassy expanse of the park.
