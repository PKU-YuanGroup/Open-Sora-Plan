A sleek white boat with the words 'BLUE GROOVE' emblazoned in bold blue letters along its hull. The boat is moored to a wooden dock with ropes coiled neatly on the planks. The vessel's polished surface reflects the bright sunlight, and a few life jackets can be seen piled inside the boat's interior.
