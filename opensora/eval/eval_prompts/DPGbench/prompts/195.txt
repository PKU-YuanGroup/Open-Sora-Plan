As the sun begins its descent in the late afternoon sky, a pair of brown leather boots can be seen tapping against a wooden pier, shedding the remnants of the ocean's saltwater. Nearby, a brightly colored surfboard, decorated with swirls of blue and yellow, stands propped up against a palm tree, basking in the warmth of the sun to dry off. Across the sandy beach, the waves gently lap at the shore, a rhythmic soundtrack to this tranquil scene.
