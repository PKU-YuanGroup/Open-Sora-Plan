A tall metallic baseball bat, standing upright on a lush green field, is gently enshrouded by a soft pink towel with frayed edges. The clear blue sky overhead provides a stark contrast to the vibrant color of the towel. Surrounding the bat, there are a few white daisies scattered, their petals swaying slightly in the gentle breeze.
