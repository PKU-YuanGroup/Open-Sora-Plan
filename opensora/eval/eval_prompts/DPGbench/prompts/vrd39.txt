A tall, gray tower looms over the bustling street below, where cars and buses navigate through the flow of traffic. The street is canopied by a row of leafy green trees, which cast dappled shadows onto the asphalt. Behind a ruddy red car parked along the side of the road, more trees with thick foliage provide a backdrop of natural green against the urban environment. A large yellow bus makes its way down the lane, adding vibrancy to the cityscape.
