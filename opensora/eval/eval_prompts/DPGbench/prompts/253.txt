An interior wall is fitted with four square-shaped power outlets, uniformly aligned in a horizontal row directly above a ruby red, round stool. The wall's paint is a soft cream color, creating a contrast with the vibrant red of the stool. The stool's smooth texture and glossy finish reflect the ambient light, emphasizing its bold hue in the otherwise neutral-toned room.
