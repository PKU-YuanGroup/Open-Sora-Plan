a striking propaganda poster featuring a cat with a sly expression, dressed in an elaborate costume reminiscent of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The feline figure is holding a large, yellow wedge of cheese as if it were a precious treasure. The background of the poster is a bold red, with ornate golden details that give it an air of regal authority.
