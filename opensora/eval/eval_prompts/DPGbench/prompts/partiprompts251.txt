A grand piano with a glossy black finish, its lid propped open to reveal the intricate inner workings. Resting on the music stand is an open songbook, its pages filled with musical notations above the ivory keys. The piano sits in a room with hardwood floors and a high ceiling, which enhances the instrument's rich sound.
