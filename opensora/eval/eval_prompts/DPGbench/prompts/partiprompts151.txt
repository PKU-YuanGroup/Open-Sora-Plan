A vivid oil painting that depicts a surreal and dreamlike seascape, where time seems to have lost all meaning. The canvas is filled with an array of clocks and watches, all of which are distorted and melting across the barren terrain, their shapes soft and elongated in a manner that defies reality. On the left side of the painting, a small wooden table stands, its surface dominated by a golden pocket watch that has attracted a swarm of tiny ants. At the heart of the scene, there is an odd, flesh-like figure draped over a lifeless tree, adding to the enigmatic and otherworldly atmosphere of the artwork.
