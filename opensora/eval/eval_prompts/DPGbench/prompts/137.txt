Amidst the serene setting of a river bank, a single, bright rectangular bar of soap sits prominently on the rough, earthy terrain. Its surface gleams under the sunlight, contrasting with the natural surroundings. Several feet away, a curious black bear with a glossy coat cautiously approaches, nostrils flaring as it investigates the unfamiliar scent. The dense evergreen forest that lines the river's edge creates a lush, green backdrop to this unusual encounter.
