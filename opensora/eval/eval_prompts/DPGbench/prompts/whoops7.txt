A striking black bird with glossy feathers sits atop the vibrant orange petals of a Bird of Paradise flower. The unique flower is positioned in the midst of an arid desert landscape, with various cacti and sparse vegetation dotting the sandy ground. In the background, the sun casts a warm glow on the distant rolling dunes.
