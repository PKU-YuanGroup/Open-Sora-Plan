A vibrant green door stands out against the stark contrast of its surrounding white walls, which are visibly marred with smudges and streaks of accumulated grime. Next to the door rests a large black bicycle, featuring a well-worn leather seat, a sign of frequent use. The bicycle's matching black handles complement the overall stark monochrome aesthetic, making it a prominent feature within this urban scene.
