An individual is poised in a challenging yoga pose on a seafoam green exercise mat. Their left leg is anchored firmly on the ground, providing support as their right leg extends directly in front of them, parallel to the floor. The left arm reaches gracefully towards the rear, while the right arm creates a horizontal line, extending outwards from the shoulder. The subject's head is tilted back ever so slightly, showing a serene expression as light from a nearby window reflects softly off their skin.
