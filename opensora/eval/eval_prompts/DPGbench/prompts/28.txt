A beautiful red kite, with a pattern of yellow suns and blue moons on its surface, floats effortlessly against the backdrop of a pristine blue sky. Its square shape is outlined by a strong frame, and long, flowing tails that dance whimsically in the wind. Below, the soft golden sands of the beach stretch out, creating a striking contrast with the kite's vivid colors.
