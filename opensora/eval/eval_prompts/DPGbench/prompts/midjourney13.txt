A vivid and eclectic depiction of a fisherman's village drawn by Ralph Steadman, composed of dark velvet hues, contrasting with splashes of bright yellow and teal. In the foreground, a tall coconut tree sways, its silhouette framed against the backdrop of a small, bustling island. A sturdy jetty extends into the water, where several fishing boats rock gently with the waves.
