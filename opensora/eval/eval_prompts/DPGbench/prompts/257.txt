Amid the soft glow of twilight, a lone deer with a coat of warm brown and subtle spots stands still on the grassy bank of a tranquil lake. As it looks on, five geese with bright white feathers and orange beaks are captured in a moment of energetic flight, their wings beating in unison as they rise from the water's edge. The backdrop is painted with the serene surface of the lake, which reflects the blushing sky and the silhouettes of distant trees.
