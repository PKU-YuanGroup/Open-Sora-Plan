In the midst of a sprawling savanna, a regal lion with a golden mane moves gracefully near a white washing machine and matching drying machine, which appear incongruous against the rolling dunes. The sun blazes down, casting sharp shadows that contour the sand around the appliances and the feline figure. Around this unusual scene, tufts of dry grass sway slightly in the hot breeze, accentuating the isolation of the domestic objects in this wild, open landscape.
