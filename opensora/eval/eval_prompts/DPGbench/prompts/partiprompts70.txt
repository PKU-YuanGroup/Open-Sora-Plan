a geometric pattern consisting of multiple squares, each progressively smaller and nested within the other. The outermost square is a bright yellow, with each subsequent square transitioning smoothly into a deeper shade of orange as they move inward. The squares are evenly spaced, creating a gradient effect that draws the eye toward the center, where the deepest hue of orange resides.
