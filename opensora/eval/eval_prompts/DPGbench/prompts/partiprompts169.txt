a detailed watercolor painting that captures a majestic snowy owl with its pristine white feathers standing in the midst of a lush green field. The owl's bright yellow eyes are a stark contrast to the soft hues of the grass, and its feathers are intricately detailed, giving a sense of texture to the artwork. The field is dotted with wildflowers and the occasional blade of grass that sways gently, suggesting a light breeze in this tranquil scene.
