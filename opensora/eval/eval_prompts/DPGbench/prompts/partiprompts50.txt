a classic old-fashioned cocktail sits on a polished wooden bar top, its amber liquid gently hugging a large, clear ice cube. next to the glass, a white linen napkin is neatly folded, with a silver cocktail spoon resting atop. the drink is garnished with a vibrant orange peel, adding a pop of color and a hint of citrus aroma to the scene.
