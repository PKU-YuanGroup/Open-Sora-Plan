A vibrant green calculator rests neatly beside a trio of pristine white board erasers, neatly organized on a spacious, uncluttered wooden desk surface. The desk's polished finish reflects the soft, ambient light of the room, highlighting the contrast between the calculatorâ€™s buttons and its body. To the right of the calculator and erasers, there is ample space for writing materials or additional office supplies, suggesting an environment conducive to productivity and order.
