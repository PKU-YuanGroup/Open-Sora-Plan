In a sunlit kitchen, a vibrant array of green vegetables flourish in a wall-mounted planter positioned directly above a white power outlet. The lush leaves present a stark contrast to the crisp, clean paint of the wall. Sunlight streams in from a nearby window, casting a natural glow that enhances the deep greens of the spinach, kale, and herbs thriving within the urban indoor garden setup.
