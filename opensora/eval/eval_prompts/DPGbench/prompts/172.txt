A well-loved silver pot emits a gentle steam on a modern gas stove with blue flames licking at its base. In the foreground, a hand wields a vivid green marker that dances across the open pages of a sketchbook, which is sprawled casually on a nearby wooden kitchen table. The sketchbook contains whimsical drawings, random doodles intertwined with occasional splashes of color, capturing the spontaneous bursts of creativity.
