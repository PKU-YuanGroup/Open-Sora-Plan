A busy construction scene unfolds with a person clad in a high-visibility vest standing close to a large orange truck parked on the road. This individual is holding a heavy-duty bag, possibly filled with work tools, while positioned beside the truck's front end. The truck itself is equipped with a set of rugged wheels firmly planted on the pavement. Directly behind this truck, there's another of a similar make and model, creating a convoy-like arrangement. Traffic cones are arranged neatly around the primary truck, signaling ongoing work or a temporary hazard in the area.
