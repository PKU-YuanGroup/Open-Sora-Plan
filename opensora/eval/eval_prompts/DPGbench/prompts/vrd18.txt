On a wooden table outdoors, a small, portable traffic light stands beside a potted plant. A person is seated nearby, wearing reflective aviator sunglasses, a casual striped shirt, and khaki shorts. Above them, the expansive blue sky sprawls with a few wispy clouds, casting a soft light over the scene. The sunlight reflects off the lenses of the sunglasses and the surface of the table, creating a play of light and shadow.
