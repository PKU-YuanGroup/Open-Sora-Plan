Chrome silver medals, both engraved with intricate designs, can be seen gently spinning within the drum of a white washing machine. The machine is placed beside a window through which bright sunlight streams, casting a warm glow on the machine's glossy surface. The gentle rotation of the medals creates a soft clinking sound against the steel interior of the washer, which is otherwise filled with clothes on a slow spin cycle.
