a rusted submarine lying on the sandy ocean floor, its once sleek black exterior now mottled with patches of corrosion and marine growth. The submarine's hatch is partially buried in the sediment, and schools of small, colorful fish swim in and out of the broken portholes. The surrounding waters are a deep, murky blue, with shafts of sunlight filtering down from the surface, illuminating the submarine's ghostly silhouette.
