A cluster of plump, purple grapes, their surface kissed by the morning's dew, reflects the soft, golden light of the rising sun. Each grape, tightly packed alongside its fellows, shows off a frosty sheen indicating the cool freshness of early day. They hang delicately from a green vine that's draped across a rustic, wooden trellis in a peaceful garden.
