A vividly colored balloon with hues of red and blue hovers gently above a wooden cosmetics table. The table holds a delicate synthetic bristle brush dusted with powder to one side and a sleek black eyeliner pencil lying parallel to the brush. Nearby, an open compact mirror reflects the floating balloon, adding a sense of depth to the scene.
