a rustic windmill with weathered wooden blades stands amidst a field of vibrant wildflowers. the structure, painted in faded red and white, towers over the colorful blooms, which include poppies and daisies. the windmill's base is encircled by a low stone wall, and in the background, the clear sky stretches above the pastoral scene.
