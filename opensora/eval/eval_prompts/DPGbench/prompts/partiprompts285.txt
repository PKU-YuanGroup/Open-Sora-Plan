A delicate, spherical glass sculpture with intricate blue and green patterns, previously perched on a wooden shelf, has tumbled to the floor due to the lack of secure anchoring. The shelf, lined with various other art pieces, stands against a pale yellow wall. The fallen sculpture now lies near a potted fern, its position suggesting the quiet aftermath of the incident.
