a standard green tennis court with white boundary lines, where numerous bright yellow tennis balls are strewn across the playing surface. Surrounding the court is a tall chain-link fence, and there is a player's bench off to the side with a couple of rackets resting on it. The net is taut and stands prominently in the center of the court, casting a faint shadow on the ground.
