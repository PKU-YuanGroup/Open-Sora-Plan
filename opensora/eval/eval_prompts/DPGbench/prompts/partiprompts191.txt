A monochromatic photograph capturing the stark contrast of a solitary black tree against a white, snowy landscape. The tree's intricate branches are devoid of leaves, creating a network of dark lines that stand out sharply. In the background, the horizon is barely distinguishable, with the white of the snow blending into the overcast sky above.
