A young boy is seated comfortably in a cushioned chair in a well-organized living room. He is intently focused on the television screen in front of him, gripping a video game controller with both hands. Around him, the room is adorned with a few framed pictures and a plant on the windowsill, adding a touch of homeliness to the space.
