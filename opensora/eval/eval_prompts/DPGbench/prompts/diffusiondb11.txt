An ominous figure looms within the frame, a dark demonic entity with an array of infinite, wispy wings that cascade behind it like a shadowy aurora. Each translucent wing shimmers with a sinister glow, suggesting an otherworldly portal to a malevolent dimension, illuminated in an eerie spectrum of dark neochrome colors. The unsettling image, reminiscent of the haunting styles of Beksinski and Gammell, is captured through the lens of a 35mm camera, casting a tangible unease as though the entity could breach the confines of its two-dimensional prison at any moment.
