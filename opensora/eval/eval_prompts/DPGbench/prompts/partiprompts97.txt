An empty space where an invisible man would be, with a pair of horn-rimmed glasses seemingly floating in mid-air, and a pearl bead necklace draped in the space below them. In the space where his hands would be, a smartphone is held, as if being operated by the unseen figure. Around this curious scene, the room appears ordinary, with a couch and a coffee table nearby, upon which rests a scattering of magazines and a remote control.
