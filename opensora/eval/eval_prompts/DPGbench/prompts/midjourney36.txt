An ancient-inspired agora stands amidst a dense palm farm, its robust columns crafted from the sturdy trunks of Sabal palms, rising into the sky. The structure's foundation and seating areas are composed of a unique oyster shell concrete, lending a textured, gritty feel to the smooth surfaces. The space between the palms is filled with the rustic beauty of this communal gathering spot, which is both inviting and impressive in its naturalistic design.
