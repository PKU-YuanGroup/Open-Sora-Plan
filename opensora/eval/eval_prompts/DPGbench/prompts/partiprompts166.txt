An exquisite oil painting that captures a raccoon with an almost human-like poise, dressed in attire reminiscent of the 17th century. The raccoon's fur is rendered in rich, textured strokes of brown and gray, and it wears a white ruffled collar and a deep red velvet coat that would befit a noble of Rembrandt's era. The background of the painting is a muted blend of dark, warm tones, creating a subtle contrast that draws attention to the subject's detailed and expressive face.
