Two intricately designed bracelets with patterns of gold and silver hues rest at the base of a tall playground slide, which towers above them with its vibrant red and yellow plastic sides. The bracelets catch the fading light of a radiant sunset that paints the sky in brilliant shades of orange and pink. In the near distance, the silhouette of the playground swings can be briefly made out against the colorful backdrop.
