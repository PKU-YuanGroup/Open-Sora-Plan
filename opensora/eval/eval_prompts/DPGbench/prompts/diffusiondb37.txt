An artistic representation bringing together the unique styles of Artgerm, Greg Rutkowski, and Alphonse Mucha to showcase a character that bears a striking resemblance to Vitalik Buterin, resembling the fictional creature Gollum. The character is given an elongated, gaunt figure with expressive, large eyes, and is illustrated amidst an Art Nouveau backdrop, reminiscent of Mucha's work. The use of vibrant colors and detailed linework reflects the collaborative influence of the three artists, creating a striking and memorable piece.
