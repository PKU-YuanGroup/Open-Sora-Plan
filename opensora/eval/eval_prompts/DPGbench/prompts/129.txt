A well-organized glass display cabinet contains a collection of seven hairdryers, each boasting a sleek design and different hues. Adjacent to this assortment, three luxurious silver watches are elegantly showcased, their reflective surfaces glinting under the soft glow of the evening light filtering through a nearby window. The watches are arranged on a plush velvet stand that enhances their sophisticated appearance.
