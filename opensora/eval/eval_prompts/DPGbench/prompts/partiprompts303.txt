A whimsical illustration featuring a small, white baby daikon radish with little green shoots on top, dressed in a pink tutu. The radish character is anthropomorphized with tiny arms and legs, walking a brown dog on a red leash. The dog appears to be a friendly, medium-sized breed with a wagging tail, and they are both on a gray sidewalk next to a grassy area.
