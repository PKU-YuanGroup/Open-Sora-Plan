A vast, metallic extractor, its surface reflecting the pale hues of dawn, towers beside a wooden cello that sits elegantly aglow in the morning light. Both objects are bathed in a gentle, warm ambience as the sun rises, casting long, soft shadows across the floor. The extractor's robust shape and industrial design create a striking visual juxtaposition with the smooth, curved silhouette of the cello.
