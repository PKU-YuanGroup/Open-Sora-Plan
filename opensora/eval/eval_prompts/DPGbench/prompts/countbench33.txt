A vibrant canvas stretched across a 2cm thick wooden frame, adorned with the illustration of abstract, beautiful female faces depicted on three separate segments of the canvas. The artwork displays a unique juxtaposition of blooming flowers and the delicate features of women, with a rich color palette that includes hues of purple, red, and yellow. Each of the three portions of the canvas seamlessly connects, creating a continuous visual narrative that celebrates feminine beauty and botanical elegance.
