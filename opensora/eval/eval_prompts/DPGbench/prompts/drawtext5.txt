A metallic robot with a rounded head and drooping shoulders stands on a stainless steel assembly line designed for butter packaging. Surrounding the robot are tubs of spread, some of which have spilled onto the conveyor belt, causing a minor disruption. The robot's digital face displays a frown, and above it, a flashing red light signals a malfunction in the process. Large, cartoonish speech bubbles emerge from the robot, playfully emblazoned with the words, "I can't believe it's not butter!" in bold, white letters.
