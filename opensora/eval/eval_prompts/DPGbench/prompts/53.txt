Two cylindrical-shaped, golden lamps with a brushed metallic finish stand side by side, casting a warm glow on the dark wooden bedside table. The illumination from the lamps highlights a small stack of books and a pair of reading glasses placed next to them. In the background, the subtle outline of a neatly made bed can be seen, with the surrounding area cloaked in the soft shadows of the midnight hour.
