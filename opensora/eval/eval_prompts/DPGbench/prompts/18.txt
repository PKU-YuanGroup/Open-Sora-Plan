In the illumination of the evening, a trio of square-shaped white induction cookers sit neatly arranged on a large central cooking island with a smooth, marbled countertop. Around them are scattered various cooking utensils, a cutting board hosting a half-chopped onion, and a crystal-clear glass bowl filled with ripe cherry tomatoes. The overhead lights cast a soft glow on the metallic surface of the kitchen vent hood above the island, reflecting the cookers below.
