Two well-worn baseballs, their white leather stained and scuffed from use, rest on a wooden floor on either side of a vibrant yellow basketball. The basketball, with its pebbled texture and black lines, stands out in contrast to the muted tones of the baseballs. The trio of sports equipment is casually arranged, suggesting a recent game or practice session.
