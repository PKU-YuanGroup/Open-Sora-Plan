In a spacious room, three brown wooden coffee tables of varying sizes stand upon a large, ornate red carpet with intricate patterns. The tables are arranged in a semicircular fashion, supporting an array of decorative items including small potted plants and coasters. The plush texture of the carpet contrasts with the smooth, polished surface of the tables, creating a harmonious visual effect within the space.
