A vintage rectangular carriage, with intricate metalwork and wooden panels, occupies the foreground, resting on the uneven cobblestone street. Above it, the sky is overcast with dark, billowing clouds that seem to loom ominously. Nearby, a sleek, rounded hoverboard with a glossy finish gracefully glides in circles around the carriage, its futuristic design contrasting sharply with the historical vehicle.
