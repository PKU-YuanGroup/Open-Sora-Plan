A gleaming golden trophy with intricate engravings stands too tall to fit inside a small, worn brown leather suitcase that lies open on the floor. The suitcase, cluttered with clothes and other personal items, cannot accommodate the trophy's wide base and elongated handles. The surrounding space is cramped, with other travel accessories and a pair of shoes scattered nearby, indicating a packing process interrupted by the realization that the trophy must be transported separately.
