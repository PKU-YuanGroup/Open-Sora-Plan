An outdoor setting where an array of brightly painted rocks is meticulously arranged in a gridded pattern on the ground. Each stone is carefully spaced to maintain uniformity and starts with vibrant red rocks in the top right corner, progressing through the colors of the rainbow to end with deep violet ones in the lower left corner. The smooth surfaces of the stones glisten in the sunlight, enhancing the vividness of each hue.
