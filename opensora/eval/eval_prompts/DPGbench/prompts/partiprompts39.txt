A whimsical bowl of soup sits on a wooden table, its broth a vibrant green with chunks of tofu arranged to resemble the eyes and mouth of a playful monster. The words "deep learning" are spelled out in thin slices of carrot, floating on the surface of the soup. The bowl itself is a deep blue ceramic, providing a striking contrast to the lighter colors of the soup and its garnishes.
