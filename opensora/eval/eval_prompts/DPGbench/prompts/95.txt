The kitchen counter, bathed in soft afternoon light, showcases a collection of five golden keys strewn haphazardly across its white surface. Behind them rests a dark-colored microwave, designed with a nostalgic, retro aesthetic that contrasts with the modern simplicity of the surroundings. Nearby, a transparent vase holds a sprig of fresh greenery, adding a touch of life to the scene.
