A quiet scene is set within a busy commercial kitchen, where stainless steel surfaces are bustling with activity. In one corner, a gleaming white porcelain cup sits beside a large stainless steel basin, both impeccably clean and ready for their next purpose. The walls, clad in white subway tiles, reflect the glimmer of overhead lights, giving the room a bright, active atmosphere. In the background, the hum of ovens and stovetops blend with the rhythmic chopping of diligent cooks preparing for the morning rush.
