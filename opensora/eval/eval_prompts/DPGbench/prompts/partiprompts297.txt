A vibrant apple tree with a sturdy brown trunk, its branches laden with bright red, square-shaped apples, each one distinct in its geometric form. The tree is surrounded by a lush canopy of circular, green leaves that contrast sharply with the unusual shape of the fruit. Sunlight filters through the foliage, casting dappled shadows on the ground below.
