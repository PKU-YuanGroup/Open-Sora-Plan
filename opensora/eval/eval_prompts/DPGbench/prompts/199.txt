An aged and weathered workbench is laden with tools and materials, its surface coated with a fine layer of sawdust. A rolled-out tape measure and a wooden ruler lie parallel across the bench, both extending their lengths to aid in an unseen project. Beside these measuring tools, a ceramic ashtray cradles a lit cigar and a smoldering cigarette, their trails of smoke winding upwards. The ashtray is situated to the left of the measuring tools, and behind it, various unfinished woodworks can be glimpsed, suggesting the area is frequented by a craftsman.
