A solitary microphone with a silver finish stands erect on an empty stage, its round, black base firmly planted on the dark wooden floorboards. The reflective surface of the microphone gleams under the bright stage lights. Directly behind the microphone, the backdrop is a rich, crimson curtain that hangs gracefully from the ceiling to the floor.
