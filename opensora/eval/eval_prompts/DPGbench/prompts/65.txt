A vibrant display of ten round-shaped boxing gloves arranged in five pairs, each pair a different neon color, against a backdrop of a wall covered in colorful graffiti. The wall's artwork features an array of abstract designs and tags, adding an urban feel to the showcase. The gloves appear to be made of a glossy, leather-like material, and they are hung at eye level for easy viewing and selection.
