In the distance, towering black mountains with their peaks blanketed in thick layers of snow stand majestically. Against this dramatic backdrop, a flock of black birds is captured in their dynamic mid-flight, crisscrossing the scene with elegance and energy. Above them, the sky is a tapestry of deep grays clashing with the remnants of serene blue, creating a striking contrast that defines the horizon.
