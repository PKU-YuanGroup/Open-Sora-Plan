Two slender bamboo-colored chopsticks lie diagonally atop a smooth, round wooden cutting board with a rich grain pattern. The chopsticks, tapered to fine points, create a striking contrast against the cutting board's more robust and circular form. Around the board, there are flecks of freshly chopped green herbs and a small pile of julienned carrots, adding a touch of color to the scene.
