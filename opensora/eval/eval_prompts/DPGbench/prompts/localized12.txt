A vivid green iguana is perched motionlessly atop a worn wooden log, its intricate scales exhibiting various shades of green and black. Behind the reptile, a rough-textured wall stands, painted in a faded color, which contrasts with the image's predominantly dark backdrop. The shadows envelop the surroundings, highlighting the iguana as the central focus of this composition.
