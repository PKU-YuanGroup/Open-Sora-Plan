A stuffed toy monkey, with a soft brown texture, is precariously balanced on a floating log in the middle of the Charles River. It's adorned with a distinctive red and white Boston Red Sox baseball cap. In the background, the prominent buildings of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) can be seen, creating a juxtaposition of playful whimsy and academic prestige.
