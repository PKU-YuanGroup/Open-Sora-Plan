A retro-futuristic album cover that encapsulates the essence of the synthwave movement in 1985, crafted exclusively in varying shades of blue. The primary visual is an old-fashioned car emerging from the mouth of a dimly lit tunnel, its gleaming headlights cutting through the surrounding darkness. The artwork is cinematic in its composition, featuring vintage elements that suggest motion and speed, finished with a fine film grain texture that mimics the classic look of a 35mm photograph. The band's name, "BRO," is emblazoned above the image in a bold, stylized font that complements the album's overall theme.
