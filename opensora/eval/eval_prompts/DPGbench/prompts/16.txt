A hefty, red-painted chainsaw rests prominently on the surface of a sturdy, solid oak table. The metal components of the chainsaw catch the soft glow of the early morning sunlight, causing a shimmering effect. The wood's rich, deep grain stands in contrast to the boldness of the chainsaw, and there are wood shavings scattered nearby, hinting at recent activity.
