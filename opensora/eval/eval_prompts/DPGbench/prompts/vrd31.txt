Multiple pairs of skis and a single snowboard are arranged near a vehicle: several pairs of skis are neatly packed in a long box that rests directly on the snowy street, while another set protrudes from the front seat of a nearby car, hinting at preparations for a wintery adventure. Adjacent to the box on the street, a sturdy basket filled with additional pairs of skis confirms the enthusiasm for the snowy escapades awaiting. Just beyond these preparations, the car, with its frosted windows, stands proudly under a vast, clear sky, promising a day of thrill on the slopes.
