A gleaming stainless steel showerhead mounted on a beige tiled wall, with beads of water steadily dripping from its nozzle onto the glossy white porcelain urinal below. The urinal is flanked by grey dividers, ensuring privacy, and the floor beneath is speckled with small, wet splashes reflecting the dim early morning light filtering through a frosted window just out of view. The metallic fixtures of the showerhead are complemented by the chrome handles and plumbing visible under the urinal, creating a cohesive and functional restroom vignette.
