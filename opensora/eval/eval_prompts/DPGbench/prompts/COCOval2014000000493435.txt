A park bench made of weathered wood, with a large, flat-screen television set precariously on top. Behind the bench, an open umbrella with a colorful pattern provides a stark contrast to the bench's muted tones. The scene is set on a paved path with grass on either side, hinting at a public space with an unusual arrangement of objects.
