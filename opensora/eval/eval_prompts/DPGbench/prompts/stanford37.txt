A large, circular clock with a green face is affixed to the exterior of a brick building, the brickwork displaying a variety of warm, earthy tones. The clock features Roman numerals in an elegant font, and each numeral is accented with subtle gold embellishments that catch the light. Directly beside the clock, there is a single arched window with a lattice design, providing a glimpse into the building's interior.
