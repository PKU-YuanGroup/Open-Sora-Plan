a politician stands on a wooden stage, dressed in a bright red soccer jersey emblazoned with a white number '10'. In one hand, they hold a yellow and blue volleyball, gesturing with the other as they address the crowd. Behind them, a large banner hangs, displaying the emblem of a local sports team, and to their right, a podium with microphones stands ready to amplify their speech.
