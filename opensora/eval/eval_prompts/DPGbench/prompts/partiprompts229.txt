An old, rusty red pickup truck stands out with its white wheel rims, parked on a stretch of gravel road. The truck's paint is faded and peeling in places, revealing the passage of time on its body. In the truck bed, there's a collection of used tools and a couple of wooden crates, hinting at its utilitarian past.
