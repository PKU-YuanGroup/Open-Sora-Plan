In a dimly lit room, a sleek, black projector casts a bright image onto a large white screen for an evening presentation. Beside the bed, a small nightstand made of polished dark wood carries a solitary leather wallet, lying undisturbed amidst the quietude of the space. The wallet's smooth surface reflects the faint glow emanating from the projector, subtly highlighting its details and the meticulous stitching along its edges.
