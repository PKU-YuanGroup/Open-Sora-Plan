In the early hours of the day, a spacious, brightly-lit public restroom showcases two gleaming white toilets with shiny silver flush handles neatly aligned against a pale blue-tiled wall. Nearby, a pristine white urinal, also spotless and ready for use, is equipped with an automatic flush sensor. The floor beneath these fixtures is polished to a high shine, reflecting the overhead lights, and the entire space is absent of any visible debris or grime, emphasizing the meticulous cleanliness of the facility.
