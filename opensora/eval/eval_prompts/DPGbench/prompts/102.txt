Two multicolored butterflies with delicate, veined wings gently balance atop a vibrant, orange tangerine in a bustling garden. The tangerine, with its glossy, dimpled texture, is situated on a wooden table, contrasting with the greenery of the surrounding foliage and flowers. The butterflies, appearing nearly small in comparison, add a touch of grace to the scene, complementing the natural colors of the verdant backdrop.
