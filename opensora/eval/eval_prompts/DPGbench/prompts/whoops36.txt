A sizable panda bear is situated in the center of a bubbling stream, its black and white fur contrasting with the lush greenery that lines the water's edge. In its paws, the bear is holding a glistening, silver-colored trout. The water flows around the bear's legs, creating ripples that reflect the sunlight.
