Two violins with rich, brown varnish are standing upright, their necks leaning against a light-colored wooden chair. The bows are placed carefully on the ground in front of them, with the horsehair facing upwards. The instruments cast soft shadows on the polished floor, hinting at the natural light entering the room.
