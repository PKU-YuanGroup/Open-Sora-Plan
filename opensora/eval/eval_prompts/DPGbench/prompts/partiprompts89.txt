A vibrant blue wooden pyramid sits atop a glossy red plastic box, which appears sturdy and capable of supporting the weight of the pyramid. The box's surface is smooth, contrasting with the textured grain of the wooden pyramid. The objects are placed on a beige carpet, and the pyramid's sharp edges cast a slight shadow on the box, emphasizing their geometric shapes.
