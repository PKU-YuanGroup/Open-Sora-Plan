A skier, dressed in a vibrant red jacket and black pants, stands firmly on a pair of silver skis with hints of blue along the edges. They are wearing a white helmet that covers their head securely, with matching white ski goggles resting just above the brim of the helmet. The skier is positioned in the foreground of the scene, with a clear expanse of snowy terrain stretching out behind them, and the tips of their skis are just visible below the frame of the image.
