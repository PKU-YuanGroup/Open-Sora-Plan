In a well-lit room with a soft beige carpet, an individual is practicing a forward bend yoga stretch. Their torso is folded over, head nestled between their arms, with their hands lightly meeting at their feet, showing a relaxed and mindful posture. Although the knees maintain a slight bend to protect the joints, the legs remain parallel to each other, with only a small gap separating them, creating a harmonious balance in the pose.
