An old-fashioned kitchen setting with a cast-iron kettle and a ceramic teapot sitting atop a rough-hewn, wooden table that bears the marks and patina of age. The kettle's metallic surface has a dull gleam, reflecting the warm ambient light, while the teapot, adorned with a floral pattern, adds a touch of nostalgia to the setting. In the background, there is a window with curtains partially drawn, allowing for a soft natural light to fill the room. Nearby, a woven basket filled with dried flowers accentuates the rustic charm of the cozy interior.
