A slice of vibrant red watermelon, with its green rind visible, serves as a plate for a single, orange-hued cooked shrimp. The curves of the shrimp follow the crescent shape of the melon, contrasting in both color and texture. Beside the watermelon, there are droplets of water, suggesting the fruit's juicy freshness.
