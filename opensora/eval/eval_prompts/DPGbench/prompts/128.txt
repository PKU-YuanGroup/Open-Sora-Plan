Beneath the expansive night sky, sprinkled with myriad twinkling stars, a flag adorning the pinnacle of a towering lighthouse drifts gently in the evening breeze, its hues subdued by the soft silver glow of the moon. The sturdy structure of the lighthouse, painted in alternating bands of white and red, stands as a stalwart sentinel on the rugged shoreline. At the water's edge, the rough texture of the rocks is intermittently made visible by the intermittent wash of foamy waves, where a solitary lobster, its dark, glossy carapace reflecting the moonlight, slowly makes its way out of the embrace of the ocean.
