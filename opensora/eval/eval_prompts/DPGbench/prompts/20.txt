An ornate royal carriage, painted in deep red with golden trim, stands prominently against a landscape blanketed in pristine snow. Behind it, the silhouettes of tall pine trees dusted with white can be discerned through the soft haze of a winter's day. In front of the carriage, the snow-covered ground glistens under the subtle light of the afternoon sun.
