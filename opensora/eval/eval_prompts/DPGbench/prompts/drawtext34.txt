A vibrant parrot perched confidently on the wooden railing of an old pirate ship, its feathers a bold mixture of greens, blues, and reds. It's donned a small, comically endearing pirate hat atop its head. The backdrop is filled with the taut ropes and billowing sails of the ship, and emblazoned across the image is a humorous caption declaring, "I'm the captain now."
