three sleek, brass faucets with a modern, geometric shape stand aligned, streaming clear water into a white basin below. the sink is surrounded by a marble countertop, which reflects the light and brings out the warm golden tones of the metal. droplets of water can be seen splashing gently around the base of each faucet, indicating the force of the flowing water.
