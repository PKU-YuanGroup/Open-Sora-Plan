A vibrant green bell pepper rests to the left of a glossy red bell pepper on a wooden cutting board. The two peppers are positioned against a backdrop of a well-stocked kitchen, with an array of spices and cooking utensils in the background. The contrasting colors of the peppers create a visually appealing composition on the neutral-toned surface of the board.
