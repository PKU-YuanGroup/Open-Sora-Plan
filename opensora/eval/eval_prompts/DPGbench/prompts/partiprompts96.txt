A large Saint Bernard dog with a reddish-brown and white coat stands on its hind legs, its front paws reaching up into the air. Seated on the dog's broad shoulders is a young girl with curly hair, wearing a pink dress and a wide smile. The scene takes place in a spacious backyard, where a wooden fence can be seen in the background, partially covered by climbing ivy.
