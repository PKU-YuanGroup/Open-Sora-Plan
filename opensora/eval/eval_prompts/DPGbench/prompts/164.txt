In an open outdoor setting, a decorative coffee table with elaborate wood carvings and curved legs is positioned under the expansive blue sky of a clear afternoon. On the surface of the table, an out-of-place toothbrush with white and blue bristles sits alone. The table stands on a patch of vibrant green grass, and no other items or furniture are immediately visible in the vicinity.
