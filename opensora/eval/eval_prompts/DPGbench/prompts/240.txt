On a sturdy, wooden drafting table lies a vintage brass scale, gleaming with a polished finish alongside an extended yellow tape measure casually strewn across the table's surface. The tables crafted from a rich, dark hardwood, distinctly contrasts with stark white blueprints and rolled-up scrolls flanking the scale. The tape measure is partially coiled, with black and red measurement markings clearly visible and stretches out towards the edge of the table, indicating precise dimensions for an ongoing project.
