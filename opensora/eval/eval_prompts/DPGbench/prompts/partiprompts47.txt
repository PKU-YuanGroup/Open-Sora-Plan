A tall, transparent glass filled with the amber-colored Long Island Iced Tea cocktail, garnished with a slice of lemon on the rim. Beside the glass, there's a white napkin folded neatly on a dark wooden bar top. The drink is accompanied by a thin, black straw, and in the background, there are bottles of various liquors lined up against a mirrored wall.
