An intricate oil painting that captures two rabbits standing upright in a pose reminiscent of the iconic American Gothic portrait. The rabbits are anthropomorphized, donning early 20th-century rural clothing with the male rabbit wearing a black jacket and the female in a colonial print apron. The background features a wooden farmhouse with a gothic window, emulating the style and composition of the original artwork.
