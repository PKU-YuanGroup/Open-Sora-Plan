An image captured at dusk where the warm glow of the setting sun can be seen reflecting off the stainless-steel exterior of a pan that sizzles with seven perfectly round meatballs. Adjacent to the pan, on a hot grill, two thick, marbled steaks emit an appetizing aroma as they cook to a medium-rare finish. Random drops of oil pop and dance on the heated surfaces, signifying the heat at which these meats are being prepared.
