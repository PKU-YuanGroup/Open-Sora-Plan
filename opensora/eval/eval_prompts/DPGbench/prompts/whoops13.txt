The iconic Statue of Liberty, with its verdant green patina, stands imposingly with a torch raised high in front of the Big Ben Clock Tower, whose clock face is clearly visible behind it. The Big Ben's golden clock hands contrast against its aged stone fa√ßade. In the surrounding area, tourists are seen marveling at this unexpected juxtaposition of two renowned monuments from different countries.
