During a tranquil evening, a grey seal with inquisitive eyes explores a vibrantly illustrated book left on the coarse sands of a deserted beach. The book's pages flutter in the gentle sea breeze, revealing bursts of purples, greens, and reds. Nearby, scattered seashells and washed-up seaweed provide a natural backdrop to this unusual scene.
