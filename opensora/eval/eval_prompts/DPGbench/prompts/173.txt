In the dim light of twilight, a room is visible with a backpack resting against the wall; the backpack is a deep blue with hints of grey and sports several small pockets along its exterior. Next to it, a neon green toothbrush stands upright, propped against a clear drinking glass on a wooden nightstand. Outside the window behind them, the sky transitions to a deep navy hue, dotted with twinkling stars that create a tranquil backdrop.
