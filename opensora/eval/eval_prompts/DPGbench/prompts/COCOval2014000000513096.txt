Two men are standing in a room with walls adorned with historical memorabilia. On the left, a man dressed in a crisp military uniform gazes intently at a series of glass cases. Inside the cases, an array of bullet shells is meticulously arranged and labeled for display, while the man in the suit on the right points towards one of the exhibits, seemingly explaining its significance.
