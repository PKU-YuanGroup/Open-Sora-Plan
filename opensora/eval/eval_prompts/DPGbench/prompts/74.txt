Four square potted plants, each nestled in vibrant yellow pots, are aligned neatly on a gray concrete surface outside. They are being gently watered, with droplets of water glistening on their lush green leaves as the sun begins to set in the background. The surrounding area is quiet, and the soft light of the early evening casts a warm glow on the scene.
