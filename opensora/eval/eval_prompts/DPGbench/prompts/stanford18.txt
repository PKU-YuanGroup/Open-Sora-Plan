A delicious pink smoothie sits in the center of a clean, white ceramic plate, with a sprinkle of cinnamon dusting the surface, giving it an aromatic allure. Beside the smoothie, a ripe, yellow banana lies slightly curved, its peel gently touched by the morning light. Close to the banana, a small cluster of plump blueberries adds a vibrant pop of deep blue to the arrangement, contrasting with the soft pink hue of the smoothie and the pristine white of the plate.
