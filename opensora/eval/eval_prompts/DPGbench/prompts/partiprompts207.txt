Inside a subway train, the seats are occupied by several red pandas with soft, reddish-brown fur. One particularly curious red panda is engrossed in reading a newspaper, holding it with its black and white paws. Through the train's windows, a dense jungle with lush green foliage can be seen passing by in the background. The interior of the train is a mix of metallic grays and bright artificial lighting, contrasting with the natural colors visible outside.
