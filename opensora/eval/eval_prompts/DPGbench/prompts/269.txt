On a marble countertop, three colorful cleaning product bottles are neatly arranged next to a stainless steel sink that glints under the gentle morning sunlight. The blue, green, and yellow bottles contrast with the cool metallic sheen of the sink and the light reflects softly off their smooth surfaces. Behind the sink, the wall is adorned with white subway tiles that add a touch of simplicity to the setting.
