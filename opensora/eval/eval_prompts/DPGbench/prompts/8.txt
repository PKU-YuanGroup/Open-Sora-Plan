An eye-catching red hoverboard floats above the steel gray asphalt of a bustling urban street, surrounded by the golden hues of the setting sun during evening rush hour. The road is lined with tall buildings casting long shadows, and the air is filled with the sounds of the cityâ€™s activity. The hoverboard's sleek design and vibrant color contrast sharply with the muted tones of the concrete environment.
