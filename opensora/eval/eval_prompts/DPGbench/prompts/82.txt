In a dimly lit space, a vibrant green broom with stiff bristles is being used to sweep a muted, grey floor. Shadows stretch across the room, illuminated by the soft orange glow of a smoldering cigarette that has been left unattended. The faint light creates an eerie dance of wisps of smoke in the blue hues of the twilight. Nearby, a simple wooden chair and a metal bucket can be seen, suggesting the room's utilitarian purpose.
