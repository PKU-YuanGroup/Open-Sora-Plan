A group of fresh, green asparagus is bundled tightly together, standing upright against a clear glass container with a water droplet pattern, giving them a soldier-like appearance. They exhibit a bright green hue that graduates to a paler shade toward their fibrous stems, enhancing their natural gradient. The spears are set against a neutral-toned, textured backdrop that contrasts boldly with their vivid color and linear form.
