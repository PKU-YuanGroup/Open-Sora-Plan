A figure standing at the busy street corner is casually dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket. The jacket, slightly ruffled by the breeze, is accompanied by dark sunglasses resting on the person's face, reflecting the urban surroundings. In their grip, they hold a leather bag, its strap slung over the shoulder, while the bag itself rests against their leg.
