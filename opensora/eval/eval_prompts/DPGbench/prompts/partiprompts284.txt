Three robots of varying hues are positioned in a row, each with a distinct and sleek design. The white robot on the left boasts a glossy finish and rounded edges, while the central red robot has a more angular form with matte surfaces. To the right, the black robot stands with a metallic sheen, its articulated joints suggesting advanced mobility. They are all placed on a smooth, gray concrete floor, and behind them is a plain wall with a few cables hanging neatly arranged.
