A stainless steel fork with tines pointed upward lies atop a navy blue pencil case with white zippers, bathed in the warm glow of early morning sunlight. The pencil case, slightly ajar, reveals an assortment of colored pencils and a pair of scissors peeking out. The items are resting on a wooden desk, which has the grain pattern gently highlighted by the sun's rays.
