A cyclist wearing a dark jacket and a protective helmet is on an open road, astride a sleek bicycle with its wheels firmly planted on the asphalt. The bike's wheels, black with a reflective stripe, are in motion, indicating a journey in progress. The road ahead is clear, accompanied by the faint lines marking lanes, guiding the path for the traveler.
