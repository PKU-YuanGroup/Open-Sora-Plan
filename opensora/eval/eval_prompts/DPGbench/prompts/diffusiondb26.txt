In the depicted oil painting, we can observe Yair Lapid, gripping a torch where flames flicker wildly, cast in a dramatic, chiaroscuro light reminiscent of Michelangelo's style. He stands as a central figure amongst a cluster of people who are rendered with great detail, showcasing distinct yet harmonious facial expressions and postures. The background of the scene is a muted blend of earthy tones, creating a stark contrast that highlights the central composition of Yair and his companions.
