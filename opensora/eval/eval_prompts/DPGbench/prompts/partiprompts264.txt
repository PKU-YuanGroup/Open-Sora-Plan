Two ceramic cups filled with steaming coffee are placed on a wooden table with a natural grain finish. The cup on the left showcases intricate latte art spelling out the word "LOVE" with a heart-shaped design, while the cup on the right has the word "PEACE" beautifully crafted atop its frothy surface. Both cups have a glossy finish, and the warm lighting accentuates the creamy texture of the latte art.
