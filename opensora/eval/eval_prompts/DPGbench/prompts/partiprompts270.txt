A row of waste disposal bins neatly aligned against a concrete wall, with a brown trash bin in the center. To its left, there is a green compost bin marked with recycling symbols, and to its right stands a blue recycling bin designated for paper and plastics. The bins are situated on a gray pavement, and each has a label indicating its specific use for waste segregation.
