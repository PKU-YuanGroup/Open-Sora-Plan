A digital image depicts an animated panda character, standing at a podium in a spacious conference room, giving a presentation to an invisible audience. The panda is adorned with a blue tie and is pointing towards a large projector screen that displays bold text stating 'Diffusion Models – in the style of van Gogh,’ with swirling patterns reminiscent of the famous Dutch painter's work in the background. The room is lined with grand windows showing a clear day outside, and rows of empty black chairs face the presenting panda, suggesting an air of anticipation for the talk.
