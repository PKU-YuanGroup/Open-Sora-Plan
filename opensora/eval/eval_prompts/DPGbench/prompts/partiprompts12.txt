A scenic train journey unfolds during the monsoon season in Kerala, with raindrops rhythmically tapping against the windowpane. Inside one of the train's carriages, a plush koala bear toy, donning a small, colorful hat, is propped up against the glass, peering out at the lush landscape. Outside, numerous tall coconut trees sway gently in the rain, their green fronds glistening with moisture, creating a verdant backdrop as the train meanders through the countryside.
