a family of four, consisting of two adults and two children, strolls along a sandy beach with gentle waves lapping at their bare feet. The adults are holding hands, and the children are playfully skipping ahead. The sky above them is a clear blue, and seagulls can be seen flying near the water's edge. In the distance, a lighthouse stands tall on a rocky outcrop.
