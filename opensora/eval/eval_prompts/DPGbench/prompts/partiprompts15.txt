A towering statue of Abraham Lincoln, cast in a silvery-gray stone, is adorned with a gleaming, opaque astronaut's helmet that reflects the barren lunar landscape. The statue is positioned on the moon's surface, with its craters and dust visible around the base. In the dark sky above, the planet Earth looms large, a swirl of blue and white against the blackness of space.
