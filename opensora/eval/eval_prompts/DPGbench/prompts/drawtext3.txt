an architectural blueprint displaying a simple house design, with clean lines indicating a large triangular roof atop square walls, and a rectangular base representing the floor. The drawing is executed with precise, thin blue lines on a white background, giving it a technical and minimalist appearance. Alongside the schematics, there's handwritten text that reads 'this house is built on the principles of abstraction', suggesting an artistic or philosophical approach to the building's design.
