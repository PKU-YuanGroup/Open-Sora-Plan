A whimsical image capturing a squirrel standing upright on a patch of green grass. The squirrel, with its bushy tail and brown fur, is holding a wooden arrow above its head with its tiny paws, as if it's just won a battle. In its left hand, it grips a miniature longbow, and around it, fallen autumn leaves add a touch of natural decor to the scene.
