A slow-moving sloth, with shaggy brown fur and a relaxed expression, is seated in a bright red go-kart on a winding race track. In its three-toed claw, it clutches a ripe yellow banana, seemingly undisturbed by the race. Just a few meters behind the kart, a single banana peel lies on the asphalt track, a potential hazard for the other racers.
