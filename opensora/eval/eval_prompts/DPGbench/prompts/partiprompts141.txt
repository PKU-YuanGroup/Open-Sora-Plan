A towering Egyptian obelisk stands under a clear sky, its ancient hieroglyphs barely visible in the sunlight. Atop this stone pillar, a menacing black dragon with scales like onyx crouches, its wings unfurled and its fiery breath directed towards a solitary knight below. The knight, clad in shining silver armor, holds up a shield in a futile attempt to deflect the intense heat, while the ground around him is scorched and illuminated by the dragon's flames.
