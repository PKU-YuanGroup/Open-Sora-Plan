A small, red candle with a flickering flame is placed on the bathroom countertop, emitting a soft glow beside the large, square, white porcelain toilet. The candle's subtle shimmer reflects off the polished chrome fixtures of the bathroom, creating a warm ambiance. The size contrast between the tall, slender candle and the robust toilet form a unique visual pairing in the compact space.
