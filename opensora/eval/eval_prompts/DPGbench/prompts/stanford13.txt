A majestic bird of prey with white breast and belly contrasted by brown wings is perched confidently on the sturdy branch of a leafy green tree. Its sharp gaze, highlighted by a striking yellow eye, reveals a sense of purpose as it holds a shimmering silver fish with dark spots in its firm beak. The tree, bathed in sunlight, provides a natural backdrop, accentuating the textures of the bird's feathers and the subtle sheen of the fish's scales.
