Within an expansive auditorium, a single megaphone with a metallic finish and a bold black stripe lies abandoned on a vast, textured orange carpet. Rows of empty seats surround the area, hinting at the silence of an event now passed. The natural afternoon light filters in through large windows, casting long, soft shadows across the carpet and the solitary object at rest.
