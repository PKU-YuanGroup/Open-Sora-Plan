A picturesque scene where the expansive blue sky arches over a stationary train, which sits on a set of tracks that cut a straight line through the landscape. The train engine is an unusual sight, covered in tufts of green grass, creating a contrast between machinery and nature. In the distance, a mountain looms over the train, imposing its grandeur on the scene. Below the grass-adorned engine, the hard gravel of the track meets the edge of an asphalt road that runs parallel, with more trains in the distance continuing their journey under the vast sky.
