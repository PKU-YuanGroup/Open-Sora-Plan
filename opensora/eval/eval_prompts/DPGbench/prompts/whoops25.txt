El Castillo, a grand Mayan temple with steep stone steps and intricate carvings, rises majestically from the desert sands. The pyramid, predominantly gray with patches of lichen, dominates the arid landscape under a wide expanse of clear blue sky. Surrounding the temple, sparse desert vegetation and cacti provide a sharp contrast to the ancient structure's imposing presence.
