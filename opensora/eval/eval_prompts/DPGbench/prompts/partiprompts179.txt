A grand city fountain situated in the center of a bustling square, with a creamy white liquid cascading down its tiers instead of water. The fountain's base is surrounded by numerous cats of various colors and sizes, eagerly lapping up the milk. The stone structure of the fountain is intricately carved, and despite the unusual substitution of milk, it stands as an impressive focal point in the urban landscape.
