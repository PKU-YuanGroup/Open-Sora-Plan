A man stands in front of a bathroom mirror, a toothbrush lodged in his mouth as he brushes his teeth. The bathroom is equipped with a white porcelain sink and a small window that lets in natural light. On the counter, there's a tube of toothpaste lying next to a cup filled with assorted dental hygiene tools.
