A bright white air conditioner, its sleek rectangular form protruding slightly, is mounted high on a beige wall above eye level. Directly below, on the tiled kitchen floor, stands a vintage round gas stove, painted in a vibrant shade of red and featuring classic white knobs. The contrast between the modernity of the air conditioner and the rustic charm of the gas stove creates a distinctive look in the room.
