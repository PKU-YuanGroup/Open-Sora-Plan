In the foreground, two birds with vibrant feathers are perched upon rugged grey rocks that jut out near a tranquil pond with lush green plants at the water's edge. In the midground, a rustic wooden fence creates a boundary line, subtly dividing the natural scene from the world beyond. The background extends into a vast expanse of soft blue sky dotted with tufts of white clouds, stretching far into the horizon.
