In the waning twilight, two canvas tents, conical in shape, are nestled closely on a field of soft, lush grass, their silhouettes casting gentle shadows. Near these temporary abodes, a sturdy square table sits under the open sky, with a lone black billiard ball positioned at its center, unmoving and glossy. The scene is quiet and still, as though the entire world is holding its breath for the break shot that will commence the morning's game of billiards.
