A vibrant yellow rabbit, its fur almost glowing with cheerfulness, bounds energetically across a sprawling meadow dotted with a constellation of wildflowers. The creature's sizeable, red-framed glasses slip comically to the tip of its nose with each jubilant leap. As the first rays of sunlight cascade over the horizon, they illuminate the dew-draped blades of grass, casting the rabbit's exuberant shadow against the fresh green canvas.
