A contented sloth, with a wide grin on its face, is decked out in an eclectic ensemble featuring a sleek black leather jacket and a brown cowboy hat atop its head. It's also sporting a traditional tartan kilt paired with a smart red bowtie around its neck. In one claw, the sloth firmly grips a wooden quarterstaff, while the other supports a large, thick book with a leather-bound cover.
