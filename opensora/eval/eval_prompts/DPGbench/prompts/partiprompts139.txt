A whimsical scene where a llama, adorned with a pair of oversized, round sunglasses, stands confidently on the metallic deck of a spacecraft. The deck beneath the llama's hooves gleams with a polished silver finish, reflecting the starry cosmos that surrounds the vessel. In the vast backdrop, the Earth looms large, a swirl of blue oceans and white clouds, providing a stunning contrast to the spaceship's sleek, futuristic design.
