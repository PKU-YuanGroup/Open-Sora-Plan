A scene featuring several prominent items: a piece of matte black paper lies beneath a set of decorative zodiac-themed tarot cards, carefully placed in the center. Above this arrangement, two spherical ornaments designed to resemble moons hang suspended, with a silhouette of a mountain range providing a stark backdrop. Additionally, two white streaks, perhaps cords or decorative ribbons, run parallel to each other, intersecting the paper and the tarot cards, adding a dynamic element to the composition.
