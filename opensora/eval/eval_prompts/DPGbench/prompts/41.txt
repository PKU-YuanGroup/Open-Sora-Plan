Five red fire trucks sit parked in a semi-circle amidst a dense blanket of gray early morning fog enveloping the area. Each truck is equipped with ladders, hoses, and flashing emergency lights that pierce through the mist. The area surrounding the trucks is clear and spacious, suggesting an open field or wide street, allowing for quick movement in case an emergency call comes in.
