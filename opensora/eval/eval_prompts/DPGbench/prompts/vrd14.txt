A city scene where multiple buses are lined up on a busy street. The foremost bus, painted in a bright yellow, stands out with its large windows and advertisement banners on its sides, as a queue of similar buses parks diligently behind it. Each bus features standard black wheels and a sturdy rooftop that gleams under the sun. Amidst the lineup, passengers board the lead bus, while a row of tall green trees provides a natural backdrop to this urban tableau.
