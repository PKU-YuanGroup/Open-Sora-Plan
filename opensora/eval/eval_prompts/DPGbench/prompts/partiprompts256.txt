a quaint kitchen space with a small white goat standing amidst the appliances and cabinetry. The cabinets are a pale shade of wood, and the countertops are a matching white, cluttered with various kitchen utensils and a bowl of fresh vegetables. Sunlight streams in through a window above the sink, casting a warm glow on the goat and the tiled flooring.
