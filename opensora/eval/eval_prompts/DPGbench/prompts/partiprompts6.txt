A striking statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, depicted with a jackal's head, is dressed unconventionally in modern attire consisting of a crisp white t-shirt, a black leather jacket, and a pair of aviator goggles resting atop its head. The statue stands in sharp contrast against the backdrop of a full moon that illuminates the night sky over the sprawling cityscape of Los Angeles. The city lights twinkle in the distance, creating a mosaic of urban life behind the ancient deity's contemporary ensemble.
