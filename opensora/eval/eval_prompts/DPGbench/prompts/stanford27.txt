An imposing large building with gray stone walls and tall windows secured by dark iron bars, casting shadows on the facade. In front of this edifice, a diverse group of people walk by on the wide concrete sidewalk, some in casual attire, others in business suits, all going about their daily routines. A bustling street runs parallel to the sidewalk, filled with an array of vehicles including yellow taxis, red buses, and private cars of various makes and colors, creating a vibrant urban scene.
