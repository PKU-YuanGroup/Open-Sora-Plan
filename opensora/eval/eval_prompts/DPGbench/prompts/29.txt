A picturesque bridge bathed in the warm glow of the early morning sun, flanked by two tall antique street lights. The street lights, with their ornate metalwork and frosted glass, cast elongated shadows across the weathered stone pathway of the bridge. The tranquil scene is further accentuated by the absence of pedestrians, giving the impression of a moment frozen in time just after dawn.
