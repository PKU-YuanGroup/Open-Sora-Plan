A large blue airplane with white accents is taxiing on a vast concrete runway, its engines humming steadily. The sun is setting behind it, casting a warm glow and elongating the shadow of the plane on the ground. The runway is marked with white lines and numbers, indicating the designated path for the aircraft.
