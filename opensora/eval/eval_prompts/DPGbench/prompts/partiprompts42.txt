A chilled, transparent bottle of light beer with condensation beads forming on its surface, placed on a wooden table. A bright yellow slice of lemon is wedged onto the rim of the bottle, adding a citrus accent to the beverage. The bottle label is partially obscured by the moisture, but hints of green and gold are visible on the design.
