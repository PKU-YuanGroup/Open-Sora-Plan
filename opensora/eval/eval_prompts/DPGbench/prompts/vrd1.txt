A modern, ergonomic workspace, featuring an array of electronic devices laid out on a spacious wooden desk. There are multiple monitors side by side, with the sleek edges of each screen nearly touching. A laptop is placed to the right end of this row, its screen raised to meet the height of its larger companions. Nestled comfortably under the desk is a black, adjustable swivel chair. Various personal items are scattered about the desk, including a slim keyboard, a mobile phone to the left, and a pair of glasses lying in proximity to a pile of papers, whilst a person is seated at the desk, engrossed in work.
