On a clear warm day, the sun radiates down on a sandy beach where a close-up of a wafer cone reveals chocolate ice cream beginning to melt down its textured sides. In the background, the sea glistens and reflects the sunlight, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. The ice cream's rich brown tones contrast sharply with the blue and turquoise hues of the ocean, creating a striking visual. Nearby, a few colorful beach umbrellas are dotted along the water's edge, offering shade to beachgoers.
