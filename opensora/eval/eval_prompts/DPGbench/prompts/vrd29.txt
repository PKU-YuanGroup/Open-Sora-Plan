A modern living room arrangement featuring a sleek, flat-screen monitor placed squarely on a low wooden table, which is positioned close to a plush gray sofa. Adjacent to the sofa, there is a matching chair, creating a cozy seating area. The table, nestled between the chair and the sofa, supports the monitor and is also within reach for those seated. Above the monitor, a contemporary lamp hangs, providing ample light and adding a touch of elegance to the setup. Near the chair, the sofa presents a perfect space for relaxation, while maintaining a spatial harmony with the rest of the furniture.
