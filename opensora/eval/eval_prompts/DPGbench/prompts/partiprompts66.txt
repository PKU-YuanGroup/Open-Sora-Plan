A vibrant display of graffiti showcasing the word "GIGGLE" in thick, colorful letters splashed across a weathered red brick wall. Each letter is painted in a different hue, creating a rainbow effect that stands out against the faded background. Just beside the lettering, there's a large splotch of white paint that looks as if it has exploded from behind the word, adding a dynamic sense of movement to the static wall.
