On a smooth, beige desktop, four ballpoint pens with blue, black, silver, and red barrels are meticulously arranged at right angles to each other, creating a rectangular outline. In the center of this rectangle, five wooden pencils with freshly sharpened tips are placed with their erasers touching, forming a precise circle. The stark contrast between the rigid geometry of the pens and the soft curve of the pencils is evident upon the uniform background of the desk's surface.
