An old wooden stool with three legs and a unique triangular seat placed by the window, bathed in the soft glow of moonlight as the clock strikes midnight. The varnish on its surface has faded, hinting at its age and the many years it has stood there. Beside it, a tall grandfather clock, its pendulum swinging steadily, marks the late hour within the quiet room.
