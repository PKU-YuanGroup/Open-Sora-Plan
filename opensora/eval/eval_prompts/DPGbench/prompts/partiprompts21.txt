A detailed photograph captures the image of a statue with the likeness of an ancient pharaoh, unexpectedly accessorized with a pair of bronze steampunk goggles resting atop its head. The statue is dressed in an anachronistic fashion, featuring a crisp white t-shirt and a fitted black leather jacket that contrasts with its traditional headdress. The background is a simple, solid color that accentuates the statue's unconventional attire and the intricate details of the steampunk eyewear.
