An image of a newspaper lies flat, its bold headline 'Local pig eats prize pumpkin' emblazoned across the top in large lettering. Below the headline, there's a photograph capturing a pink pig with muddy spots, surrounded by the remnants of a once massive, bright orange pumpkin, now half-devoured. The paper appears slightly crumpled, emphasizing its texture, with the photograph and text clearly visible against the off-white background of the newsprint.
