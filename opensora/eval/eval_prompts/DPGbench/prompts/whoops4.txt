A striking orca whale is seen gliding through the blue waters of the Nile River, its black and white pattern contrasting vividly against the river's hues. In the background, the ancient silhouette of an Egyptian pyramid looms, its sandy beige stones bathed in the sunlight. The surface of the water ripples lightly as the majestic creature navigates the unusual setting, with palm trees and desert landscapes visible on the riverbanks.
