A solitary figure stands on a sandy beach, shaded by a large red and white striped umbrella. The person is clad in bright yellow shorts and appears relaxed while under the protective cover of the umbrella. A silver metallic can lies on its side, partially buried in the sand, just a few steps away from the person's bare feet.
