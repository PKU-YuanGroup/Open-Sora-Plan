a vibrant field of tall sunflowers standing against a clear blue sky, with one large, cheerful flower in the foreground about to be overwhelmed by an approaching green tractor. the sunflower's bright yellow petals and deep brown center contrast the cold metal of the tractor's body. the ominous caption 'after the sunflowers, they will come for you' overlays the image, giving an eerie foreshadowing to the scene.
