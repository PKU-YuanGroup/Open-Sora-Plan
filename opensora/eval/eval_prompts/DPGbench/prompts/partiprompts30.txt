An intricately arranged wooden charcuterie board is adorned with an assortment of farm animal figurines, each skillfully crafted from various types of cheese and slices of ham. The cows, sheep, and pigs are positioned amidst a landscape of crackers and grapes, creating a playful barnyard scene. In the background, a brown dog with perked ears and a glossy coat sits attentively, its gaze fixed on the edible menagerie with an unmistakable look of longing.
