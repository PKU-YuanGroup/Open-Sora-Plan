A ripe, golden pineapple sits centered on a light wooden table, with a single green-bottled beer to its left and a pair of identical bottles to its right. The beers have droplets of condensation on their surfaces, indicating they are chilled. The pineapple's spiky green leaves contrast with the smooth, cylindrical shape of the beer bottles.
