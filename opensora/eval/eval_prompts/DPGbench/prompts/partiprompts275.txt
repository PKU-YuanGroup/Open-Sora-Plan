An innovative water sculpture shaped like a flat-screen television stands in the center of a dimly lit room. The liquid crystal display, made entirely of cascading water, presents a luminous cityscape at night, with twinkling lights from skyscrapers and a reflection of the moon on the water's surface. Surrounding the unique installation, the floor is tiled in dark hues, accentuating the ethereal glow of the projected urban scene.
