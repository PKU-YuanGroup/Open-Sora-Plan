an elderly woman with shoulder-length straight gray hair and round metal-rimmed glasses sits comfortably in a plush armchair. She is wearing a lavender cardigan over a white blouse, and a silver necklace can be seen around her neck. In her lap rests an open hardcover book, and beside her, a small wooden side table holds a ceramic teacup and saucer.
