An evocative tintype photograph by Ansel Adams, capturing the chilling tableau of gaunt, skeletal figures with the mythical visage of Icarus, their bodies conjoined in a macabre ballet as they plummet through a midnight sky. The figures are adorned with an array of feathered wings that are sprawling from their emaciated frames in a desperate, though futile, attempt at salvation. High levels of detail reveal the intricate interplay of shadow and light, casting an otherworldly glow across the scene that harkens back to the haunting visual narratives of the 1800s.
