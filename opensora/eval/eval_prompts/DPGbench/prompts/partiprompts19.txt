Inside a temple, a unique wall painting captures the whimsical image of pandas engaged in a game of tennis, rendered in a style reminiscent of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. The pandas are depicted with exaggerated, playful expressions, using rackets that are stylistically simplified. The wall on which the painting is displayed has a textured, sandy hue, providing a stark contrast to the dark, bold lines of the painted figures.
