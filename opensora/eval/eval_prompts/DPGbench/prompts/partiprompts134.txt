A whimsical image captures a green frog with a contemplative expression, sitting comfortably on a lily pad while holding a newspaper. The newspaper, humorously titled "Toaday," features a bold headline and an illustration of another frog on its front page. The frog's webbed fingers are spread across the paper, which is slightly crumpled from being held.
