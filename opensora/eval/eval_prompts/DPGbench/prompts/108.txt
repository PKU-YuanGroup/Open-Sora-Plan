In a silent library setting, bathed in the soft glow of ceiling lights, stand two metal tripods, each clasping a single piece of white notepaper. Both tripods are positioned at the end of a long, mahogany table scattered with books and reference materials, hinting at a late-night study session. The library's rows of bookshelves cast long shadows on the carpeted floor, creating an atmosphere of calm scholarly focus as the clock strikes midnight.
