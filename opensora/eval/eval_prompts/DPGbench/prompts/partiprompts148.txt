A panoramic view of a sprawling field blanketed with vibrant wildflowers, where a tall giraffe and a striped zebra stand side by side. The giraffe's long neck stretches towards the blue sky, while the zebra's black and white stripes provide a stark contrast against the multicolored floral backdrop. In the distance, a line of acacia trees can be seen under the bright sunlight, completing this picturesque savanna scene.
