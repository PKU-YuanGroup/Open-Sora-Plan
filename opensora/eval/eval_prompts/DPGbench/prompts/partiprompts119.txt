a group of four musicians performing live on a modestly-sized stage with bright spotlights casting shadows behind them. The lead singer, clad in a red leather jacket, grips the microphone stand, while the guitarist, dressed in a black shirt, strums his electric guitar with fervor. The drummer, situated at the back, is partially obscured by his drum kit, and the bassist sways to the rhythm. In front of the stage, a small but enthusiastic audience is gathered, some with raised hands, enjoying the live music.
