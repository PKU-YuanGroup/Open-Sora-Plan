A young boy with forlorn expression gazes downward, his hair tousled as though he's had a long day. He's clad in a plain white t-shirt that contrasts with the intricate designs of a temporary sleeve tattoo adorning his arm. The tattoo features a mixture of colorful dragons and floral patterns that extend from his shoulder down to his wrist. Nearby, a set of colored markers are strewn about, suggesting a recent artistic endeavor.
