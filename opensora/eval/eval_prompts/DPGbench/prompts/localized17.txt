A closer look at the ground reveals a scattering of rocks in a mosaic of colors and shapes. Some are small, weathered pebbles tinged in earthy browns and soft grays, while others are larger, jagged stones with hues of deep red and speckled granite. The varied textures are evident, from smooth, water-worn surfaces to the coarse, granular feel of the larger boulders, all lying haphazardly on a bed of sandy soil.
