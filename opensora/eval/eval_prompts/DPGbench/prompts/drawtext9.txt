A colorful scene at the shoreline with a red crab sitting on the golden sand, beside a vibrant turquoise surfboard. The sun, resembling a massive, glowing orange orb, hangs low in the sky, which is painted with a spectrum of a rainbow's hues. Thought bubbles appear above the crab, filled with the words 'you are all that matters', hinting at a whimsical, introspective moment on this picturesque beach.
