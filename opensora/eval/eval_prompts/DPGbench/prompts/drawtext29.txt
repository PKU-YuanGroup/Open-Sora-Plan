An artist's rendition of the Hubble Space Telescope, bathed in the glimmer of distant stars set against the backdrop of the sprawling Milky Way galaxy. The image is rich with hues of blue and purple nebulas, and the telescope appears as a sophisticated structure with reflective solar panels. Overlaying this cosmic panorama is bold, inspirational text that reads 'The Universe is a Mystery, But We Are Here to Solve It', signifying the relentless human pursuit of knowledge beyond our world.
