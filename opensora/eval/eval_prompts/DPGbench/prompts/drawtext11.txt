An aerial view of Toronto's skyline dominated by the iconic CN Tower standing tall amongst the surrounding buildings. The image is taken from the window of an airplane, providing a clear, bird's-eye perspective of the urban landscape. Across the image, the words "The CN Tower" are prominently displayed in the playful Comic Sans font. The cluster of city structures is neatly bisected by the glistening blue ribbon of a river.
