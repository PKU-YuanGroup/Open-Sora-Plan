The photograph captures a wide expanse of sky with trees dotting the horizon, their leaves vibrant green against the blue backdrop. Below, neatly stacked boxes rest against a black metal railing, which runs parallel to the lush grass. Scattered around the vicinity, miscellaneous objects are haphazardly placed. The composition is framed with elegant black borders on both the left and right sides, giving the image a structured finish.
