Long: Scattered across the dark wooden floor are long, jagged shards of a shattered mirror, each piece reflecting the intense, yellow eyes of a great horned owl perched nearby. The owl's feathers are a mix of deep browns and soft grays, and it sits stoically on the branch of an indoor plant. The room is dimly lit, casting a moody glow that enhances the sharpness of the mirror fragments and the piercing gaze of the owl.
