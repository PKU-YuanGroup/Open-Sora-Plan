A gray donkey with a tuft of dark mane lies tranquilly beneath the expansive branches of a large oak tree that sits at the edge of a meandering river. The river's crystal-clear waters reflect the lush greenery of the banks and the vibrant blue sky above. In the background, the gentle slope of the riverbank is dotted with wildflowers and tall grasses, creating a picture of pastoral serenity.
