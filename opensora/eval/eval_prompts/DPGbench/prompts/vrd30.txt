A functional kitchen setup featuring a stainless steel stove seamlessly integrated into wooden cabinetry. Beside it, a tall white refrigerator stands, its surface dotted with an array of colorful magnets. Above the nearby sink, a sleek chrome faucet curves elegantly. The refrigerator and stove are positioned in close proximity, creating a convenient cooking triangle. On the countertop, a ceramic bowl rests atop a matching plate, suggesting a meal recently prepared or soon to be enjoyed.
