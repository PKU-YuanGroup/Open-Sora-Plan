Inside a peaceful home, the kitchen area features a stainless steel faucet, its sleek surface catching the light, towering just above a straw broom with bristles slightly frayed from use. The broom leans casually against a cream-colored wall, adjacent to the polished granite countertop that houses the sink and faucet. Around them, the kitchen is filled with other everyday utensils and appliances, creating a sense of domestic normalcy.
