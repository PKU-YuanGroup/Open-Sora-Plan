a vibrant abstract painting featuring three geometric shapes: a large blue triangle, a smaller yellow triangle, and a red triangle, all against a white background. The blue triangle has a smooth texture, while the yellow and red triangles have a more textured, almost brush-stroked appearance. The shapes are arranged in a way that suggests dynamic movement and balance within the composition.
