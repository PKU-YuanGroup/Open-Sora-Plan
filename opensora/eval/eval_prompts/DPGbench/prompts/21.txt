An elegant, lustrous emerald green necktie is carelessly strewn across the slick, polished surface of a dark mahogany dining table. The fine silk texture of the tie contrasts with the wood's deep, rich grain. Beside the tie, a scattering of loose papers and a silver pen give an impression of a hasty departure, perhaps after a morning of work or a formal event.
