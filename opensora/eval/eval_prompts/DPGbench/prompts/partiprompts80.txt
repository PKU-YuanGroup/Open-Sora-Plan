A shiny metallic blue sphere rests to the left of a vibrant yellow felt box on a smooth, gray surface. The sphere reflects the light, creating a gleaming highlight on its curved surface, while the felt box has a soft, matte texture that contrasts with the sphere's reflective finish. The box appears slightly larger than the sphere, and both objects are positioned against a neutral background that emphasizes their colors and textures.
