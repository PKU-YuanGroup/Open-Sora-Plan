Three glossy billiards balls, each distinctly colored in solid hues of red, yellow, and blue, are captured in a dynamic roll across a vibrant green felt billiards table. In stark contrast, a pair of granite curling stones with colored handles rest motionless nearby, their polished surfaces reflecting the soft, ambient lighting of the room. The billiards balls, significantly smaller in size compared to the hefty curling stones, navigate the expanse of the table with ease and precision.
