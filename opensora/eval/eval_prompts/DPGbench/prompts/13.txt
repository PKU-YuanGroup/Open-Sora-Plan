A sleek, black rectangular keyboard lies comfortably on the luxurious beige carpet of a quiet home office, bathed in the gentle sunlight of early afternoon. The keys of the keyboard show signs of frequent use, and it's positioned diagonally across the plush carpet, which is textured with subtle patterns. Nearby, a rolling office chair with a high back and adjustable armrests sits invitingly, hinting at a quick break taken by its usual occupant.
