Three exquisitely crafted violins, with their elegant F-shaped sound holes and smooth, glossy wooden surfaces, rest gently beside a grand piano. The piano's polished ebony finish reflects the soft, gentle curves of the violins that lie on a velvet-lined case. Behind them, the piano's open lid reveals its intricate strings and hammers, inviting a symphony of sounds to be played.
