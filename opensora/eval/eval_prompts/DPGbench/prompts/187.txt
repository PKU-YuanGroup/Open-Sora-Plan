On a smooth, polished wooden desk, there are five small square-shaped power converters with a metallic finish neatly placed beside each other. Behind them, two round pink erasers lie in contrast to the wood grain, slightly showing signs of use with pencil shavings nearby. The desktop itself is bathed in the warm glow of the room's lighting, highlighting the gentle textures of the wood and the matte surfaces of the converters and erasers.
