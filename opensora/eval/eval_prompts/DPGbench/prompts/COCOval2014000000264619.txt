A sandy beach scene where a man stands at the water's edge, clutching a brightly colored surfboard under his arm. In the distance, two wind gliders are skimming across the surface of the ocean, their sails billowing in the breeze. The horizon is dotted with small boats, and the sky above is clear, hinting at favorable conditions for water sports.
