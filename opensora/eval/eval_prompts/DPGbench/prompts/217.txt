On a rainy day, three umbrellas with bright and varied colors—yellow, red, and blue—are opened wide and positioned upright on a worn, wooden table. Their fabric canopies are dotted with fresh raindrops, capturing the soft, diffused light of a hazy morning. Beside these umbrellas lies a classic round watch with a leather strap and a polished face that reflects the muted light. The watch and umbrellas share the table's space, hinting at a paused moment in a day that has just begun.
