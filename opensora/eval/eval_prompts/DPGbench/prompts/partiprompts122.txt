A majestic granite statue of a wombat warrior, clad in intricately detailed armor, stands proudly in the center of a temple's cella. The statue, gripping a broad sword with both hands, is bathed in a soft beam of light that filters down from an unseen source above, highlighting the textures of its stony surface. It is perched upon an ornate pedestal, which adds to its imposing presence. The scene is captured through a wide-angle lens, giving it a grandiose and expansive feel, reminiscent of an anime-style oil painting with vibrant colors and dynamic shading.
