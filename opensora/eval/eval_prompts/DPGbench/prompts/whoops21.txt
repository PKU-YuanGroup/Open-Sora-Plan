A young child, no more than three years old, with a red sweater and mismatched socks, steps off the sidewalk onto a busy street with cars approaching. The child appears oblivious to the dangers, focused on a toy in hand. Around them, the traffic includes a bright yellow taxi and a blue sedan, both coming to a quick halt to avoid the child.
