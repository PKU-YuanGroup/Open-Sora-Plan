A person stands in a poised stance with their legs straight, making contact with each other down to the feet, which are clad in black, lace-up shoes. Their back maintains a subtle lean forward, suggesting a stance of attentiveness or mild anticipation. Their arms rest casually along the sides of their body, with hands gently relaxed. The person's head is tilted just a fraction to the left, their gaze perhaps fixed on an unseen object of interest in their immediate vicinity.
