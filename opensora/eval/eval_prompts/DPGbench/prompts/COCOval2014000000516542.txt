A series of colorful signs are lined up along the roadside at the town's edge, each promoting different library events. The signs feature dates and times for upcoming book sales, author readings, and children's story hours. The backdrop to these signs is a quiet street that leads into the heart of the town, with the library itself visible in the distance.
