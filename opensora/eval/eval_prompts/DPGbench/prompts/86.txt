A medium-sized brown dog with a shiny coat stands in a large room filled with warm, yellow sunlight streaming in from a nearby window. The curious canine directs its attention towards a pristine white porcelain urinal situated awkwardly in the center of the otherwise unfurnished space. The room's aging, cracked walls, painted a once-bright shade of blue, provide a stark contrast to the urinal's smooth and clean surface.
