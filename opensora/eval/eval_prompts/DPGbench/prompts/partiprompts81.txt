a flag with three distinct vertical stripes prominently displayed against a clear sky. The leftmost stripe is a deep blue, the middle is a crisp white, and the rightmost stripe is a vibrant red. The flag is attached to a silver pole that is mounted on a grey building, fluttering gently in the breeze.
