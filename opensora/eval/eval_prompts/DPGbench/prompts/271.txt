In a room bathed in the warm glow of the late afternoon sun, a single large golden camera sits prominently on a desk. This camera, with its polished metallic finish, outshines and is notably bigger than the two smaller silver monitors positioned on either side of it. The edges of the monitors are reflecting the soft light, creating a contrast with the camera's shining surface.
