Ten School Resource Officers are set to serve in seven local school districts, as part of the School Resource Officer (SRO) Program led by Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell. The officers, in their distinct uniforms, will be a significant presence in the school environment, providing security and fostering relationships with the students. The schools, each with its unique architectural design and color scheme, will benefit from this added layer of security and community engagement. This initiative is a significant part of the district attorney's efforts to ensure a safe and conducive learning environment for the students.
