A giant faux oyster, with a rough textured exterior akin to rock, opens to reveal its sleek interior resembling a lustrous pearl. From within its spacious maw, a vintage camera with black leather casing and silver details gently slides out as if it were an oversized pearl escaping the confines of its shell. The camera is caught mid-motion, creating a sense of dynamic action against the still life of the display.
