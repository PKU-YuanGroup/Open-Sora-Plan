Inside the microwave sits a clear glass bowl, filled to the brim with scoops of colorful ice cream with visible flecks of vanilla beans. The microwave's interior light casts a warm glow on the ice cream, which threatens to melt if the door were to remain closed for long. It's an odd place for a cold dessert that's usually served at a chilly temperature to avoid its creamy contents from turning into a soupy mess. The microwave is positioned on a countertop, surrounded by assorted kitchen gadgets and a spice rack full of various seasonings.
