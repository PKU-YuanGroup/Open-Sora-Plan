In the spacious backyard, a large square green trash bin stands firmly on the grass, its solid structure stark against the natural setting. Approaching it, a vibrant red baseball rolls steadily across the lawn, its round shape contrasting with the rectangular contours of the bin. The grass, slightly damp, leaves a faint trail on the ball as it moves closer to the stationary receptacle.
