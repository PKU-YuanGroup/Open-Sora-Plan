A person in an athletic stance with a focused expression, balancing on their left leg that is extended straight beneath them, touching the ground. Their right leg is bent at the knee and lifted behind their body, muscles tensed in a dynamic posture. Both arms are stretched out in front, parallel to the ground, with hands facing down as if they are about to begin a sprint.
