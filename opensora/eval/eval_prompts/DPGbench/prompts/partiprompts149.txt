A fluffy white poodle, adorned with a red baseball cap, stands on its hind legs in front of a green chalkboard. In one paw, it holds a large, open dictionary, while the other paw is used to scrawl the word "bonez" in white chalk. The floor beneath the poodle is scattered with colorful pieces of chalk, and the room is filled with small wooden desks and chairs, suggesting a classroom setting.
