In the corner of a dimly lit room, a rectangular, charcoal-gray computer box exhibits its sharp edges as it rests beside an elegantly draped, cherry-red silk bow tie. The contrast between the electronic's matte finish and the tie's glossy sheen is striking. The computer appears dormant, while the bow tie seems almost ready to be picked up and worn to an event. Behind these objects, the ambient lighting casts soft shadows against the plain, light-colored wall.
