Greta Thunberg, the environmental activist, is captured in a photograph holding a clear disposable plastic cup. The cup, seemingly out of place considering her advocacy, is juxtaposed against her usual image of supporting sustainable practices. She is standing outside, with a small crowd in the background, all focused on the scene unfolding around them. Greta's expression is serious and contemplative, with her signature long braid and casual attire.
