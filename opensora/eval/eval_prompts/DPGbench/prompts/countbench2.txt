The sky is adorned with the impressive formation of four sleek Blades aircraft, each painted in vibrant hues of red and white, with their contrails presenting a mesmerizing spectacle as they perform 26 consecutive loops, an endeavor set to break a world record. Mike Newman, who is visually impaired, daringly executed the initial loop with commendable skill before his co-pilot seamlessly assumed control for the remainder of the gravity-defying feat. Onlookers on the ground watch in awe as these agile planes carve perfect circles in the azure canvas above, their engines humming in harmonious unison.
