An eye-catching bright red megaphone rests on its side, situated in close proximity to a sleek black microphone that stands upright on a dark stage. The stage itself is equipped with various electronic devices and cables running across its surface, hinting at the preparations for an upcoming event. The microphone, with its polished metal finish, gleams under the stage lights, waiting to project the voice of the speaker into the night.
