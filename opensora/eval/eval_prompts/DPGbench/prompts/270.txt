A deserted park scene illuminated by a soft moonlight where an orange frisbee lies on the grass, slightly tilted to one side. Nearby, a wooden cello and its bow rest in solitude against a weathered park bench, their elegant forms casting long shadows on the pavement. The surrounding trees sway gently in the breeze, indifferent to the forgotten items left in the wake of an earlier emergency rehearsal.
