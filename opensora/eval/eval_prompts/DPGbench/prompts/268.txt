On a rustic wooden table, a vibrant purple paintbrush, significantly larger than the standard size, lies beside a pair of silver-grey pliers with a matte finish. The bristles of the paintbrush appear soft and well-used, indicating a tool that has seen many a canvas, while the pliers show signs of wear, with slight scratches and smudges from frequent handling. The contrast between the artistic instrument and the utilitarian tool is striking against the natural grain of the wooden surface.
