A classic wooden rocking chair with a smooth, varnished finish sits adjacent to the green, chain-link fence of a tennis court. The court's surface is a vibrant blue with white boundary lines, and a few tennis balls can be seen resting near the net. In the background, there's a tall fence that separates the court from a row of dense, neatly trimmed hedges.
