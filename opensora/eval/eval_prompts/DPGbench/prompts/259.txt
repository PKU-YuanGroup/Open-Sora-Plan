As the first rays of the morning sun spill over the market, a glimmer catches the eye from beneath a stark white awning, where a series of five ornate, golden cosmetic mirrors are carefully arranged. Each mirror, varying in size from small handheld to large tabletop versions, reflects the vibrant hustle and bustle of the early market goers. The stands surrounding the mirrors boast an array of colors from the goods for sale, highlighting the diverse cultural tapestry of the community.
