A spacious room with a high ceiling, where a single, narrow beam of natural light streams down from a small skylight above. This focused beam of light casts a warm glow upon an easel standing directly beneath it. Mounted on the easel is a detailed Rembrandt-style painting, depicting the intricate features of a raccoon's face, which is highlighted by the light against the otherwise dim surroundings.
