A solitary figure stands on the sandy expanse of the beach, identifiable as a lifeguard by the bright red shorts and white tank top they are wearing. The sky above is a blanket of grey, hinting at the overcast weather as gentle waves rhythmically roll onto the shore. Beside the lifeguard, a vivid yellow and black rescue board leans against a wooden post, its surface speckled with droplets from the sea's mist. Nearby, the shoreline extends into the distance, marked by the sporadic presence of seagulls and scattered shells.
