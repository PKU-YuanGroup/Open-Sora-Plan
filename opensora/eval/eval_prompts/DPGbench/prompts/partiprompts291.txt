Two flags are flying side by side against a clear sky; the first is a white flag emblazoned with a bold red circle in its center, while the second is a solid blue flag with no markings. The flags are attached to grey metal poles that stand in close proximity to each other, creating a striking contrast of colors. The fabric of the flags ripples gently in the breeze, highlighting their distinct and vibrant hues.
