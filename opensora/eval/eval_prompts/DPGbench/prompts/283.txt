A small, silver lighter with a gentle flame flickering at its tip is placed beside a large, gleaming golden trophy on a polished wooden table. The trophy is intricately designed, with handles on each side and an engraving that signifies some kind of sporting achievement. The wooden table's surface reflects a faint glow from the lighter's flame, adding a subtle warmth to the surrounding cool metallic and wooden textures.
