Three delicious-looking sandwiches, overflowing with fresh lettuce, crisp cucumber, and ripe avocado slices, are neatly aligned on a sleek, glass-top table. Each sandwich is encased in a golden-brown bread that has been lightly toasted to perfection. The sunlight pouring through a nearby window casts a warm glow, accentuating the vibrant colors of the vegetables and making the table's glass surface shine with reflected light.
