Two vibrant yellow pendant lights dangle gracefully from a thick, black wire, illuminating the area beneath them. Below the glow of the lights stand two lush green trees, their leaves rustling slightly in a gentle breeze. Beside these trees rests a tall tan building, its walls smooth and unassuming in the soft light. Scattered next to the building are various signs, displaying bold letters and symbols, directing passersby and adding a splash of color to the urban landscape.
