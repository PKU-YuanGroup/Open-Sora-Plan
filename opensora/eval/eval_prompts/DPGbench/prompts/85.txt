A vivid nuclear green electric drill in action, its bit spinning rapidly as it bores into a thick, black leather belt. The power tool's textured grip ensures a firm hold and starkly contrasts with the sleek, dark surface of the belt, which is held down against a sturdy wooden workbench. Around the drill, shreds of black material and wood dust are scattered, evidence of the tool's forceful endeavor.
