A quaint, single-engine propeller plane with a vibrant paint job rests in the middle of a wide-open grassy field. The field is bordered by a simple fence and a few scattered trees in the distance. The plane's small size suggests it's designed for personal or recreational use, and it sits idle under the clear sky.
