A detailed painting depicts an ancient, ornate treasure chest with intricate carvings and a heavy, rusted metal clasp, nestled in the shadows of a dark, damp cave. Beside the chest, a broad sword with an embellished hilt stands propped up, its blade catching the faint, eerie glow emanating from within the chest. The rough texture of the cave walls is accentuated by the contrast of the sword's gleam and the chest's subtle sheen.
