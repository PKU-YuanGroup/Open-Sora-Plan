A cozy bathroom features a pristine, white claw-foot bathtub on a backdrop of pastel green tiles. Adjacent to the tub, a tower of soft, white toilet paper is neatly stacked, glimmering gently in the diffuse glow of the afternoon sunlight streaming through a frosted window. The gentle curvature of the tub contrasts with the straight lines of the stack, creating a harmonious balance of shapes within the intimate space.
