A warm and inviting living room featuring a plush beige couch with a colorful throw pillow. Above the couch hangs a whimsical painting of a corgi, framed in a simple black frame that contrasts with the light-colored wall. In front of the couch, a round wooden coffee table holds a clear vase filled with fresh flowers, adding a touch of nature to the space.
