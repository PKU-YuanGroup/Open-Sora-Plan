A pristine white bird with a long neck and elegant feathers stands in the foreground, with a towering dinosaur sculpture positioned behind it among a grove of trees. The dinosaur, a deep green in color with textured skin, contrasts sharply with the smooth plumage of the bird. The trees cast dappled shadows on the scene, highlighting the intricate details of both the bird and the prehistoric figure.
