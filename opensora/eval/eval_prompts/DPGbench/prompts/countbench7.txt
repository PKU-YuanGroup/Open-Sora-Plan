In the vibrant backyard of a suburban home in Yarmouth, Maine, USA, three children of varying ages (a toddler around 2-3 years old, a preschooler aged 4-5, and a young child around 6-7 years) are gleefully playing in the spray of a water sprinkler. The lawn, lush and green, serves as a soft cushion under their bare feet as they run and jump through the scattering droplets of water. The afternoon sun highlights the joyful expressions on their faces as they engage in this quintessential summertime activity.
