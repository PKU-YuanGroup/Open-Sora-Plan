A smooth, rectangular bar of dark chocolate lying on a white marble surface, with the ironic word "WRAPPER" embossed on its surface in bold letters. The chocolate bar, with its neatly segmented squares, is unwrapped and ready to be broken apart and enjoyed. Surrounding the bar, there are faint traces of its former gold foil wrapper, crinkled and pushed aside.
