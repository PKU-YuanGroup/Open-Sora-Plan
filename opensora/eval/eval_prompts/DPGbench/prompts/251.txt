A small, round glass flask sits filled with a brightly colored, luminous potion on an aged wooden tabletop, its contours clear and sharp. The flask seems tiny in comparison to the massive stainless steel rice cooker positioned in the corner of the room, its steam vent puffing gently as it diligently prepares a sizeable meal for a nocturnal feast. The tabletop's surface is scattered with a few pieces of parchment and an assortment of dried herbs, which adds to the contrast between the delicate glassware and the robust kitchen appliance.
