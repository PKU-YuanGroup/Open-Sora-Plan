a magnificent underwater sculpture depicting an angel with intricately designed wings that mimic the delicate structures of coral. The statue is positioned in a way that creates a majestic silhouette against the filtered light from above, evoking a sense of awe and mystery. This visual composition, with its dramatic upward angle and the interplay of shadow and light, brings to mind the stylistic elements associated with the cinematic aesthetics of the film "Blade Runner 2049."
