An intricately detailed oil painting depicts a raccoon dressed in a black suit with a crisp white shirt and a red bow tie. The raccoon stands upright, donning a black top hat and gripping a wooden cane with a silver handle in one paw, while the other paw clutches a dark garbage bag. The background of the painting features soft, brush-stroked trees and mountains, reminiscent of traditional Chinese landscapes, with a delicate mist enveloping the scene.
