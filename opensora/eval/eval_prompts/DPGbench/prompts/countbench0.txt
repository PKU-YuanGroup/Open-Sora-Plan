A close-up photograph provides a bird's-eye view of an elegant tea selection box, partitioned into neat compartments. Each section cradles a different variety of tea, carefully wrapped in paper sachets with small labels indicating their flavors. The box itself boasts a light gray base with artistic splashes of vibrant oranges and pinks, adding a touch of vivid color to the array of teas presented within.
