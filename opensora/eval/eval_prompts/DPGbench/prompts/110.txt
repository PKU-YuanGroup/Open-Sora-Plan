A single, long green onion with its pristine white root end and vibrant green top stands upright in a tall, thin, clear glass vase. The delicate onion contrasts with the smooth and solid form of the vase which rests upon the speckled granite kitchen countertop. The morning light filters through a nearby window, bathing the onion and vase in a gentle, diffused glow that highlights their subtle textures and colors.
