An elegant brass saxophone rests upright on a stand in the center of a dimly lit stage, its polished surface catching the limited light and casting a warm glow. The slight shimmer of the instrument stands in stark contrast to the dark, empty chairs surrounding it, evoking a sense of anticipation. Its curves and keys are highlighted by a single beam of spotlight, waiting to come to life in the quiet twilight of the auditorium.
