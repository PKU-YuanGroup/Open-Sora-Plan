a gathering of several cats with various coat patterns sitting attentively around a small table. A whiteboard stands in the background with the phrase "stack more layers" scrawled across it in bold, black marker. The room is filled with miniature chairs and a tiny coffee mug placed at the center of the table, suggesting an organized feline meeting.
