A modern office space featuring a sleek, transparent glass desk upon which five identical flat, rectangular smartphones are arranged in a precise, evenly spaced line. Each phone reflects the overhead lighting, emphasizing their dark, glossy screens. To the side of this technological display, a single roll of white toilet paper stands out, its soft texture a stark contrast to the smooth glass surface, poised precariously at the desk's edge as if forgotten in haste.
