A visually striking mixed media piece featuring a central photograph of a woman with flowing orange hair that cascades over her shoulders. The background contrasts with a monochromatic sketch of a bustling city skyline, complete with towering skyscrapers and intricate architectural details. The woman's piercing gaze seems to transcend the two-dimensional space, creating a dynamic interplay between the realism of the photograph and the abstract nature of the sketched cityscape.
