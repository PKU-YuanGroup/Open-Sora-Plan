Rows of seats are occupied by attentive audience members, each holding small containers of assorted vegetables. The theater is semi-lit by the glow of the screen, casting a soft light on the vibrant greens, reds, and yellows of the fresh snacks. No traditional popcorn can be seen; instead, the room is filled with the sound of crisp, healthy bites.
