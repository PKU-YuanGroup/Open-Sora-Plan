In a dimly lit room, a stark black blackboard and a pristine white whiteboard are mounted next to each other on a pale wall, creating a striking contrast. The whiteboard is clean, while the blackboard has faint remnants of chalk dust. Directly below them, on a brown wooden table, rests a single pink folder, its bright color standing out in the quiet shadow of the evening.
