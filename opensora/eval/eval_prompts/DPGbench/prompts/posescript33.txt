A figure is poised in an active stance, with their buttocks pushed back and their torso inclined forwards, suggesting a sense of readiness or engagement in an activity. Their arms are extended downwards, positioned close to the body, with elbows bent and hands reaching straight out in front, as if ready to grasp or manipulate something. The person's head is subtly tilted back, indicating a focus towards the ceiling or sky, possibly observing something of interest or intent above them.
