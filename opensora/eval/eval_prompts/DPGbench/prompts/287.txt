In an expansive field, a chestnut horse with a flowing mane is captured in the midst of a powerful buck, its hooves churning up tufts of green grass. Adjacent to the field, a playful seal can be seen in a clear blue pond, its slick body arcing gracefully as it performs an energetic flip, splashing water droplets into the air. The surrounding area is dotted with wildflowers and a wooden fence encloses the field, maintaining a boundary between the terrestrial exuberance of the horse and the aquatic acrobatics of the seal.
