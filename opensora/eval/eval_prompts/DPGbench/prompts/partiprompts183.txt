a concrete sidewalk running alongside a weathered wooden post, which has a bright blue '5' prominently painted on its flat top surface. The post is planted firmly in the ground, with patches of green grass sprouting around its base. To the side of the sidewalk, there's a neatly trimmed hedge that stretches out of view.
