A person practicing a yoga pose on a light grey mat in a spacious room with white walls. He stands firmly, balancing on his left leg while his right knee is bent upwards, and his right hand gently holds his right ankle. His left arm is extended back, enhancing his poise, and his gaze is intently fixed towards the left corner of the room, displaying a sense of concentration and balance.
