A solitary camel, with its characteristic humps and creamy beige coat, slowly ambles beside a striking, plush, round red couch, which seems oddly out of place in the vast desert landscape. The harsh midday sun casts a sharp shadow from the camel, dwarfing the small couch in comparison. Around the odd couple, the endless sea of sand contrasts with the vibrant red upholstery, as no other objects or signs of life interrupt the peculiar desert scene.
