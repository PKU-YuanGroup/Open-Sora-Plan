An expansive dining space features a large wooden table with three additional extension leaves, providing ample room for guests. Around the table, there are six matching chairs, each crafted with elegant design, and among them, a Leander high chair stands out, specially designed for a child to join the family meals. The table is set under a hanging chandelier that casts a warm glow over the polished surface of the wood.
