A realistic human skeleton, its aged bones a stark off-white, stands erect in the center of an empty, dust-covered swimming pool. The skeleton clutches a golden spear, its tip gleaming even in the muted light, held aloft as if in a declaration of power. Red drapery is artfully hung around the skeleton's frame, creating a strong contrast with its pale bony structure and the dull grey of the pool's concrete.
