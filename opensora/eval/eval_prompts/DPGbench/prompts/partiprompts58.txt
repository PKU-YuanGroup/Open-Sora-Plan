A piece of golden-brown toast resting on a white ceramic plate, topped with bright yellow, freshly sliced mango. The mango slices are arranged in a fan-like pattern, and the plate sits on a light wooden table with a few crumbs scattered around. The texture of the toast contrasts with the soft, juicy mango pieces, creating an appetizing snack.
