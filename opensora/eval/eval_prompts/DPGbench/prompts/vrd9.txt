A historic building stands majestically with a clock tower that reaches towards the sky. The face of the clock is clearly visible, set upon the tower's brick structure. Behind the beautiful edifice, soft clouds drift across the blue sky, while in the foreground, a lush green tree partially obscures the view of the building, its branches stretching out beneath the open sky. Across from the main structure, the tower stands out, a landmark that serves both as a visual focal point and a timekeeper for those who pass by.
