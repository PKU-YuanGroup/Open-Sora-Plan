A spacious, open book lies flat on a wooden table, its pages filled with blocks of text and a large, detailed illustration of a cat on the right side. The illustration depicts a gray feline with intricate patterns, lounging amidst a backdrop of sketched furniture. The left page is densely packed with small, black font, narrating a story that accompanies the image, and the edges of the book's pages show signs of frequent use.
