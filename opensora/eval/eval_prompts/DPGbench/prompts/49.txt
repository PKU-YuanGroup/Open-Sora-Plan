Two emerald green briefcases, both with a finish that's smooth to the touch, rest side by side upon the polished surface of an aged oak desk. The wood grain detailing on the desk is prominently displayed in the soft, diffused light of the afternoon sun that filters through a nearby window. Each briefcase is adorned with silver clasps that catch the light, creating a subtle but striking contrast against the dark, rich tones of the wood beneath them.
