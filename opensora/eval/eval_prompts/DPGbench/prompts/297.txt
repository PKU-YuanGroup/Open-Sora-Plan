In a homey living area, against the backdrop of a pastel-hued wall, a sturdy mahogany side table stands adjacent to a plush, large teal couch. The side table features a lamp with a cream shade and a scattering of paperback books stacked neatly on its surface. Positioned comfortably next to the couch, the side table complements the warm ambiance, while the couch offers an inviting place to relax, covered with throw pillows in shades of teal, mustard, and gray.
