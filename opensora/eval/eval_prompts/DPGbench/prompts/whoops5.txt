In the scene, a silver-framed magnifying glass with a black handle is being held over a glossy-screened smartphone, which displays an image that is being enlarged. The smartphone, lying on a wooden table with fine grain patterns, is surrounded by a few scattered papers and a green potted plant to its side. The details on the phone's image become more pronounced under the scrutiny of the magnifying lens, which is held steadily by a hand with a silver watch on its wrist.
