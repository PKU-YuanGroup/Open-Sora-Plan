A modern kitchen scene where a stainless steel gas stove ignites with a soft blue flame, casting a warm glow on the surroundings. Close by on the granite countertop rests a green glass bottle, which reflects the flickering light, creating subtle reflections around it. The stove is surrounded by various cooking utensils and a spice rack filled with an assortment of colorful spices.
