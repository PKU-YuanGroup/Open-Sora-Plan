On a rich maroon stage, a quintet of grand pianos gleams under the stage lights, their polished black surfaces reflecting their surroundings. Each piano is encircled by a small scatter of walnuts, their round, brown shapes contrasting with the sleek lines of the instruments. The pianos are methodically arranged, allowing ample space for performers to maneuver around them during a recital.
