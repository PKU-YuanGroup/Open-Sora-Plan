On a bright day, a trio of sunshine yellow shrimp can be seen scuttling about the base of a striking zebra, its coat a contrast of black and white stripes reminiscent of a starry sky without a moon. The zebra stands casually on a patch of vibrant green grass, seemingly unfazed by the small crustaceans exploring around its hooves. The sun casts a warm glow on the scene, enhancing the vivid colors and casting short shadows on the ground beneath the animals.
