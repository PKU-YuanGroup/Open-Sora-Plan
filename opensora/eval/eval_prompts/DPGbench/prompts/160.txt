As the sky transitions into hues of orange and purple during twilight, a sleek silver sailboat cuts through the calm waters. On the deck of the boat, a small makeshift kitchen setup can be seen, where someone is carefully preparing long, string-like noodles. The gleaming surface of the boat reflects the fading sunlight, and the gentle ripples on the water create a tranquil scene. Nearby, the silhouette of the coastline is just barely visible against the evening sky.
