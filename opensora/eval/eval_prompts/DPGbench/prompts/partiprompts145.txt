A majestic brown horse stands in profile, its coat gleaming in the sunlight, with a black saddle securely fastened on its back. The number 55 is prominently displayed in white on the horse's rear flank, indicating its identification or racing number. The horse's mane is neatly combed, and it appears calm and well-trained, ready for a ride or competition.
