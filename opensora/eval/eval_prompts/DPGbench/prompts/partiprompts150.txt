An oil-on-canvas masterpiece that captures the dynamic essence of a blue night sky, bursting with the energy of swirling azure hues and speckled with stars that seem to explode in shades of yellow. Dominating the celestial scene is a luminous, fuzzy-edged yellow crescent moon, casting its soft glow from the upper portion of the canvas. Below this cosmic display, a tranquil village is depicted to the right, its quaint houses huddled in repose. On the left, a towering cypress tree stretches upwards, its branches undulating like flames, creating a stark contrast against the serene sky. In the distance, amidst the gentle roll of blue hills, the spire of a church stands tall, a silent sentinel overlooking the sleepy hamlet.
