Two ceramic cups sit side by side on a wooden table, one filled with a steaming latte that has a detailed foam art depiction of the United States map on its surface. The other cup, equally warm, showcases an intricate latte art representation of the African continent. Both cups have a glossy finish, and the table reflects the soft glow of the overhead lighting.
