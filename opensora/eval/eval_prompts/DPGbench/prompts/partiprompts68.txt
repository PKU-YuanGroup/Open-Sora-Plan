In the center of the composition, there is a neatly arranged stack of three vibrant red cubes, each with a smooth, glossy finish that reflects the ambient light. To the right of this stack, there is a deep blue sphere with a matte texture, providing a stark contrast to the geometric sharpness of the cubes. On the left side, two emerald green cones with a slightly textured surface are positioned, their pointed tips directed upwards, creating a symmetrical balance in the arrangement.
