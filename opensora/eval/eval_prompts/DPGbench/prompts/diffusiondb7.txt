An artistic fusion of styles reminiscent of the great masters like H.R. Giger's dark surrealism, Richard Schmid's refined realism, and Jeremy Lipking's contemporary impressionism comes to life in a striking full-length portrait painting. The expansive canvas is filled with loose, impressionistic brushstrokes that capture the haunting beauty of a Victorian-style giant spaceship. The vessel exists in an otherworldly space, its intricate metalwork framed by ethereal swaths of color, giving it an almost dreamlike presence amidst the undefined, loose genre of the painting's background.
