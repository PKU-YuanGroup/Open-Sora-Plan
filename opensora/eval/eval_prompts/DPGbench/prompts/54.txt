In the gentle light of the early morning, three red stuffed animals—two teddy bears and a plush fox—are propped against a soft pastel-colored wall within a peaceful nursery room. The wall itself is painted in a gradient of pastel hues, creating a calming backdrop for the vibrant toys. The toys' plush fabric appears soft to the touch, and they sit closely together as if in a huddled group, providing a cheerful contrast to the subtle tones of the room. Nearby, a white wooden crib with delicate bedding completes the serene setting, signifying the presence of a young child's space.
