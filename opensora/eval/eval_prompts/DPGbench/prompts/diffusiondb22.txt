an intricately detailed character drawing by Bastien Lecouffe Deharme featuring an elderly gentleman with long, flowing grey hair. He possesses majestic, large grey wings that extend from his back, conveying both wisdom and strength. The refinement of the character is further accentuated by a polished monocle nestled over one keen eye, and he is dressed in sophisticated attire that hints at a bygone era of elegance.
