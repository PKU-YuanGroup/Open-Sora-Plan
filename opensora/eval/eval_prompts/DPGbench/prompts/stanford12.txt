A vibrant array of very green broccoli florets rests on a large square plate, accompanied by a scattering of slender yellow beans. Both vegetables are lightly coated in a pale, creamy sauce that adds a subtle sheen to the dish. The plate itself, with its expansive, flat surface, provides an ample canvas for the vividly colored, healthy meal.
