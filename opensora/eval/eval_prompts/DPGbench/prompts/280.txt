A modern, spacious room bathed in natural sunlight, featuring a clean white wall and a hardwood floor with a subtle sheen. In the center, a pair of white sneakers sits side-by-side, neatly positioned on the floor. Wrapped around them is a single brown leather belt with a polished buckle that glints in the light, creating a sense of order within the space.
