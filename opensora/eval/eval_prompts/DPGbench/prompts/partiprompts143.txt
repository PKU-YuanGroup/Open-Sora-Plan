Two sea creatures, a swordfish with its elongated, pointed bill and a narwhal with its iconic spiraled tusk, are engaged in an underwater duel on a sandy seabed that resembles an arena. The swordfish's sleek, silvery body contrasts with the mottled gray and white of the narwhal as they circle each other. On the sidelines, a bright red crab and a dark-shelled lobster wave their claws enthusiastically, as if cheering on the competitors amidst the swaying sea plants.
