An expansive airport terminal alive with the hurried steps of travelers, featuring white tiled floors and large glass windows revealing views of parked airplanes. Overhead, a lattice of metal beams supports a ceiling from where seven dome-shaped black surveillance cameras keep a vigilant eye on the bustling concourse. Amidst the flow of people, rows of blue and grey seating areas are interspersed with digital flight information displays.
