A gleaming pair of golden cymbals lies in stark contrast to a collection of round, static bottles of toiletries arranged neatly on a shelf. The metallic sheen of the cymbals is emphasized by the surrounding muted tones of the shampoo and lotion containers. The bathroom shelf upon which they rest is made of polished oak, adding a warm touch to the setting.
