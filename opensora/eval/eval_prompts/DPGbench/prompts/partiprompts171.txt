a detailed 17th-century Dutch Baroque painting depicting a chestnut horse standing amidst a vibrant field of tulips and daisies. The horse's mane and tail are elegantly captured by the artist, flowing with the gentle breeze that seems to animate the scene. In the background, a traditional windmill sits under a partly cloudy sky, completing this pastoral landscape.
