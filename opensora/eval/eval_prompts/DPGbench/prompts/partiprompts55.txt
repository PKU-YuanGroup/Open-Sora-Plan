A stream of white milk flowing gracefully from a clear glass pitcher into a deep blue ceramic bowl. The bowl is sitting on a marble countertop, surrounded by a scattering of fresh strawberries and a box of cereal. Sunlight filters through a nearby window, casting a warm glow on the scene and highlighting the smooth texture of the milk's surface.
