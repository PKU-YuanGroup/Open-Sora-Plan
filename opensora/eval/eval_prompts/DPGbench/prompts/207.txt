A contemporary bathroom features a white hanging shelf, securely mounted on a pale blue wall, showcasing an assortment of toiletries. The items include a glass container of cotton swabs, a small plant in a terracotta pot, and an array of bottles with chrome caps reflecting the soft overhead light. Below the shelf, a plush cotton towel, perfectly fluffed and of a gentle lavender hue, hangs elegantly over a polished chrome towel bar.
