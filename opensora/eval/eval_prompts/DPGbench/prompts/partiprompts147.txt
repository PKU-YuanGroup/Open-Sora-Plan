A glossy black dog with a curious expression sits snugly between a lush green bush and an unusual pair of green pants that stand upright as if an invisible person were inside them. The pants are supported by a hidden frame, creating a whimsical garden display. The dog's shiny coat contrasts with the matte texture of the foliage and the fabric of the pants.
