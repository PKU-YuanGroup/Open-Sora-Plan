A figure depicted with a dynamic pose: its left arm extends forward while the right arm is elongated back, parallel with its spine. Both legs are positioned closely together in a near vertical line, with the right leg gracefully stacked atop the left. The silhouette reflects a ballet dancer's poise during a challenging balancing act.
