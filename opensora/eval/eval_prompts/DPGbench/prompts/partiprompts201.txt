a picturesque mountain stream with crystal clear water flowing over smooth, rounded stones. Several salmon, their scales glistening with a pinkish hue, can be seen leaping energetically from the water, attempting to navigate upstream. The banks of the stream are lined with lush green vegetation, and small wildflowers peek out from the foliage.
