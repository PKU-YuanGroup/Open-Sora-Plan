An old skateboard with scuffed edges and faded stickers leans delicately against the rough texture of a red brick wall. Its wheels, well-worn and dusty, hint at many adventures it might have seen. Nearby, the early morning sun casts a soft glow on the ground, accentuating the contrasting textures of the brick and the smooth, aged wood of the skateboard deck.
