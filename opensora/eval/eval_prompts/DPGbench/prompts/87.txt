A collection of three vibrant magenta hats, each featuring a unique pattern and texture, are arranged side by side on a dark, polished wooden surface. Nearby, two translucent bottles with intricate designs reflect the ambient light. The bottles are carefully positioned to the right of the hats, and their contents cast a slight shadow on the wood grain.
