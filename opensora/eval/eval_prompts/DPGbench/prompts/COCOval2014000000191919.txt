A pastoral scene unfolds with a herd of cows scattered across a lush green field, leisurely grazing under the open sky. The field is bordered by a simple wooden fence, and in the distance, a cluster of trees can be seen lining the horizon. The cows, with their varied brown and white patterns, appear content in their tranquil environment, occasionally lifting their heads to survey their peaceful surroundings.
