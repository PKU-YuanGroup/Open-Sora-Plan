A detailed sculpture of an ancient pharaoh, crafted from a lustrous bronze metal, stands imposingly against a plain backdrop. The statue is adorned with a pair of intricate steampunk glasses that rest on the bridge of its sculpted nose, and it wears a weathered leather jacket draped over a crisp white t-shirt. Emblazoned on the shirt is a detailed illustration of a space shuttle, adding a modern twist to the traditional regal attire.
