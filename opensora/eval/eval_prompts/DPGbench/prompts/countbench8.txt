In a spacious living room, two 3-seater sofas with plush white cushions are symmetrically positioned opposite each other, creating a welcoming conversational area. Between them sits a nature grey 39" coffee table made of Ostuni white mahogany, giving off a rustic yet modern vibe. Surrounding the central coffee table, three matching lounge armchairs with grey upholstery offer additional seating, enticing guests to relax and enjoy the space. The arrangement of the furniture promotes easy movement and social interaction within the room.
