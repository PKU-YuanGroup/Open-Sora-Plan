Two vibrant red jugs are carefully positioned below a trio of open black umbrellas, which stand stark against the backdrop of a grey, stormy sky. The jugs rest on the wet, glistening concrete, while the umbrellas, with their smooth, nylon fabric catching the breeze, provide a sharp contrast in both color and texture. Each umbrella casts a protective shadow over the jugs, seemingly safeguarding them from the impending rain.
