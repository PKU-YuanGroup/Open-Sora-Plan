a rustic wood cabin nestled in a clearing, its dark brown logs contrasting with the bright green of the surrounding grass. In front of the cabin, there's a circular fire pit made of stacked stones, with a few wooden benches arranged around it. The fire pit is currently unlit, and a stack of chopped firewood is neatly piled to one side, ready for use.
