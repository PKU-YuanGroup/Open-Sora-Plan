A 35mm film still capturing a scene from David Lynch's reimagined version of 'The Wizard of Oz', with the setting transposed to the lush, green backdrop of the Pacific Northwest. In the frame, a Dorothy character dons a plaid dress reminiscent of flannel, common in the region, and her ruby slippers contrast with the verdant forest floor. Towering evergreens and a hazy mist encapsulate the background, providing an enigmatic touch true to Lynch's signature style.
