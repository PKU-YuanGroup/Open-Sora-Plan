A bundled-up individual trekking through freshly fallen snow, wearing a thick black jacket, fitted blue jeans, and sturdy boots designed for winter weather. This person has their head covered with a warm hat and is carefully navigating in front of a muted-color building that shows the subtle signs of weathering from the cold season. Nearby, a solitary parking meter stands encased in a layer of snow, its coin slot obscured by the icy accumulation.
