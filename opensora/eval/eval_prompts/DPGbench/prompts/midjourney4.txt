A stage designed with a fusion of natural and industrial elements, featuring sleek silver glass panels reminiscent of a high-tech laboratory, situated alongside a soft, feathered carpet. The flooring transitions into an area of polished wood leading to a sturdy stone wall, adding an earthy touch to the synthetic ambiance. Overhead, raw concrete merges into the form of a salvia patens roof, juxtaposed with a tranquil sand-laden backdrop that suggests the gentle shores of a lake. In the center, an oval mirror with a slim steel frame reflects the composed space, including the transparent screen that adds a layer of modernity to this eclectic setting.
