A steaming bowl of Pho, with a rich, clear broth and a generous topping of fresh bean sprouts. The bowl sits on a dark wooden table, accompanied by a side plate of lime wedges and basil leaves. The noodles are submerged beneath the broth, and thin slices of beef float on the surface, partially obscured by the green sprouts.
