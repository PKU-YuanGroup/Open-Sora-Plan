Two individuals are deeply engrossed in a strategic game, seated at a polished wooden table with a chessboard that uniquely features all black chess pieces. The players, both wearing glasses, are in a room with cream-colored walls and a potted plant in the corner. To the side of the chessboard, a timer is set, indicating the serious nature of their contest. The sunlight from the adjacent window casts a soft glow on the game, highlighting the intricate details of the ebony pieces.
