Three graceful antelopes are seen grazing on the sparse, golden grasses of the sprawling savannah under the soft, purpling skies of dawn. The silhouette of an acacia tree punctuates the horizon as the first light of day gently begins to illuminate the vast, open plain. With delicate movements, the animals move slowly, their tan and white coats blending subtly with the earthy tones of their serene surroundings.
