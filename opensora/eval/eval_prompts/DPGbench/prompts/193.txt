An aged wooden nightstand with an elegant finish stands beside a tall bed, supporting an oversized violin that stretches beyond its edges. The gentle evening light cascades through an adjacent window, casting a warm amber glow on the instrument's polished surface. Intricate details on the violin's body glimmer subtly, capturing the essence of its classical beauty.
