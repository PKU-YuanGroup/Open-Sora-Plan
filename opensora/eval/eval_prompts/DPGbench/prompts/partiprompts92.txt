A detailed photograph captures the intricate features of a pharaoh statue adorned with unconventional accessories. The statue is wearing steampunk glasses that have intricate bronze gears and round, reflective lenses. It is also dressed in a stark white t-shirt that contrasts with a dark, textured leather jacket draped over its shoulders. The image is taken with a high-quality DSLR camera, ensuring that the textures and colors of the statue and its attire are vivid and sharp. The background is a simple, unobtrusive blur, drawing all attention to the anachronistic ensemble of the pharaoh.
