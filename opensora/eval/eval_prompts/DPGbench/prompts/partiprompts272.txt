A massive, red-striped ball made of lightweight styrofoam, careened into a small, round wooden table, causing it to collapse under the unexpected force. The table, previously adorned with a delicate lace tablecloth and a ceramic vase, now lies in disarray with the broken vase and scattered flowers beside the remnants of the table. The ball, seemingly unscathed by the collision, rests awkwardly against the splintered wood of the shattered table.
