Under the warm glow of an overhead light, a shiny chrome showerhead is poised above a pristine white bathtub with clawed feet. The porcelain surface of the tub is speckled with droplets of water, ready to embrace the evening's tranquility. To the side of the bathtub, an assortment of lavender-scented bath products and fluffy towels are neatly arranged, hinting at the luxurious bath time ritual that awaits.
