A small infant with round, silver-framed glasses perched on their nose is comfortably sitting in the center of a plush white bed. The child, dressed in a pale yellow onesie, holds an open, colorful picture book with both tiny hands, appearing to gaze intently at the illustrations. Surrounding the infant are an assortment of plush toys, including a fluffy blue bear and a soft green frog, scattered about the soft, cream-colored bedspread.
