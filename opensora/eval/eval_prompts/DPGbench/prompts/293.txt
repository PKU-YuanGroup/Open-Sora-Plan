At a bustling farmer's market stall, a ripe hamimelon with its signature netted green rind and succulent orange flesh lies beside a crisp head of lettuce, which displays vibrant green leaves. The two fresh produce items bask under the diffuse amber light of the late afternoon sun, which casts a soft glow over the array of fruits and vegetables. Around them, an assortment of seasonal goods is neatly arranged on wooden tables, inviting customers to sample the local harvest.
