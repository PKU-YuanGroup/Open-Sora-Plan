Two woven baskets with brown and tan hues rest gently on the vibrant green grass in a peaceful meadow. The larger basket, slightly ajar, reveals a cozy blanket peeping out, while the smaller one seems to be packed with a picnic setup. Surrounding them, a few wildflowers add specks of color to the tranquil scene, uninterrupted by the gentle breeze swaying the grass blades.
