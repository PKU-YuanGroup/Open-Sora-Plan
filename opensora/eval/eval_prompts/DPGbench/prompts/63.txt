Atop the smooth green felt of a billiard table, three glossy red cue sticks lay orderly in parallel, as if awaiting their players. Around the edges of the table, a scattering of billiard balls rests in the calm before a match, each reflecting the warm, fading light of dusk creeping in through nearby windows. The room is quiet, and the ambiance suggests the anticipation of an evening game, with the only movements being the gentle sway of a ceiling fan above and the shadows stretching across the floor as the sun sets outside.
