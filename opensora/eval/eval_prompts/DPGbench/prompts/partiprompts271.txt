a neatly printed quote, 'Do unto others as they would do unto you,' in a simple black font centered on a pristine white canvas. The text is surrounded by a thin black border, and the canvas is positioned against a light grey wall. Just below the quote, in smaller letters, the source of the saying is attributed, adding a touch of elegance to the presentation.
