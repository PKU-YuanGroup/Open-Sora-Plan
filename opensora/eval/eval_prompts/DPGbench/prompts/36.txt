An elegant pair of glasses with a unique, gold hexagonal frame laying on a smooth, dark wooden surface. The thin metal glints in the ambient light, highlighting the craftsmanship of the frame. The clear lenses reflect a faint image of the room's ceiling lights. To the side of the glasses, a leather-bound book is partially open, its pages untouched.
