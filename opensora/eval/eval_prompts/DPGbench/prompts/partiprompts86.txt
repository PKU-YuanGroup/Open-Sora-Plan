A sizable blue box with a smooth, matte finish sits prominently in the center of the room. Atop its surface rest three small, vibrant yellow boxes, each with a glossy texture and sharp, clean edges. The blue box's substantial size dwarfs the trio of yellow boxes, creating a striking contrast in both color and scale.
