A large, bold sign with the words 'KEEP OFF THE GRASS' is painted in white letters on a weathered brick wall. The wall has a rough texture and shows signs of age with some bricks slightly chipped and discolored. In front of the wall, there's a small strip of green grass that appears well-maintained, contrasting with the urban backdrop.
