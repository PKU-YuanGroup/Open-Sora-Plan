An antique rickshaw with chipped and faded red paint stands solemnly under the vast expanse of an early morning sky tinged with the soft hues of dawn. The worn seat, hinting at many years of service, looks out over an empty cobblestone street that hints at the day's quiet beginning. Rustic details of the rickshaw's metalwork become more apparent in the gentle morning light, indicating its rich history and the countless stories it could tell.
