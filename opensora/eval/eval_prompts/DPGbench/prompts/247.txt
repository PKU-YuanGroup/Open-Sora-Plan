A sleek, silver hair dryer and a pristine white bar of soap are neatly placed next to one another on a marble bathroom countertop. The backdrop of the setting sun casts a warm, orange glow through the window, illuminating the array of toiletries and fluffy towels in soft light. The reflective surface of the countertop enhances the soothing ambiance created by the sun's fading rays.
