A city scene where a yellow school bus stands on an asphalt road, its large black wheels pressing against the firm surface. The road stretches underneath the bus and continues beyond the frame. Behind the stationary bus, the shadowy appearance of a white van can be glimpsed, poised as though in a momentary pause. Rising above the scene, the outlines of buildings stand, adding depth and an urban backdrop to the moment captured. The repetition of the van and building behind the bus indicates perhaps a slight congestion, common in city traffic scenarios.
