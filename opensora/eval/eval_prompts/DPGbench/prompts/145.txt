Three brown chickens with glossy feathers are gathered around a large, metallic silver hammer lying on the ground. The hammer's handle is engraved with intricate designs, and it reflects the sunlight, drawing the birds' attention. The chickens appear to be pecking and bobbing their heads curiously, as if they are performing a dance in a circle around the tool. Nearby, blades of green grass can be seen poking through the soil, adding contrast to the scene.
