In the calm and pristine setting of a forest blanketed in snow, three colorful skiboards are positioned vertically against a tree trunk, their pointed ends etched with vibrant patterns and designs standing out against the white backdrop. Beside them, two wooden hockey sticks lie, their shafts crossing over one another in a silent contest of height, both adorned with faded tape near the blade. The smooth, icy surface of a nearby frozen pond can be glimpsed through the trees, hinting at a recent winter sport rendezvous.
