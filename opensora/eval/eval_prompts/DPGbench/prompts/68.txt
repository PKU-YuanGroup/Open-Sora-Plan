An artist with fingers dusted in multicolored pigments is holding a set of five cylindrical-shaped paint brushes that sport vibrant blue handles. These brushes are gently splayed between skilled fingers, poised like a conductor's baton ready to orchestrate strokes on a pristine white canvas that awaits on an easel. The bristles of the brushes appear soft and unused, contrasting with the worn-in look of the artist's hand, evidencing countless hours of previous creations.
