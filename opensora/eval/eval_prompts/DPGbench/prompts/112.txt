Scattered across the polished hardwood floor, five vibrantly yellow cobs of corn lie in a haphazard formation, untouched and contrasting with the dark grain of the wood. Nearby, a mop with a wooden handle rests against a light grey wall, its stringy head soaked and discolored from use. The room is illuminated by the subdued, monochrome light of early morning, casting soft shadows across the cobs and the floor.
