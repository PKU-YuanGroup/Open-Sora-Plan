In the center of a dimly lit stage, a vintage green guitar with a glossy finish leans gently against a classic black amplifier. The polished wooden flooring of the stage reflects the warm, golden hue from a single spotlight above, which casts an inviting glow over the instrument. A microphone stand with a chrome finish stands to the left of the guitar, poised for the evening's performance.
