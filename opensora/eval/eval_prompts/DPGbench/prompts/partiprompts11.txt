On the barren, gray surface of the moon, two chestnut horses adorned with silver harnesses are depicted pulling an antique carriage. In the surreal background, the Statue of Liberty stands tall, its green patina contrasting with the sandy hues of the Great Pyramid nearby. Above this otherworldly scene, the Planet Earth hangs majestically in the dark lunar sky, its blues and greens vibrant against the starkness of space.
