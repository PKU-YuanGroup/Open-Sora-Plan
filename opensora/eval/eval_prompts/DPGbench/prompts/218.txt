As the sun sets, casting a warm glow over the playground, a striking bright orange baseball bat lies half-buried in the sandy ground near the curved metal slide. The slide, painted in bold primary colors, forms a perfect arc that glistens with the residual daylight. Sparse footprints around the area hint at earlier games and laughter, now quiet in the evening's calm.
