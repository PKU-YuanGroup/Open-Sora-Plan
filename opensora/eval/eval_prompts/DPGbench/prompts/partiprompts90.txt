In the detailed Renaissance paintings, the Virgin Mary is depicted seated gracefully within a stone loggia, her robes a rich blend of blues and reds, with delicate folds that suggest softness and depth. The background features a dreamlike, hazy landscape, rendered in muted tones through the use of the sfumato technique, which blends colors and tones subtly together. This landscape seems to stretch endlessly into the distance, with faint outlines of trees and hills, giving the impression of a serene and untouched wilderness.
