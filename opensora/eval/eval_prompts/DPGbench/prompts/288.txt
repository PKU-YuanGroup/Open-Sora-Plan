In the bathroom, a sleek circular metal sink reflects the soft overhead lighting, creating a serene and clean atmosphere. Next to the sink, three cylindrical bars of green soap are meticulously lined up, each embossed with intricate patterns, waiting to be used. The soaps rest upon a white marble countertop that contrasts with the cool, brushed finish of the sink.
