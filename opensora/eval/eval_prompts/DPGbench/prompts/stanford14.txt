A traveler stands in a busy train station, clad in a tan jacket that falls to their mid-thigh, paired with a snugly fitted gray scarf around their neck. On their back, a worn brown backpack suggests a journey in progress. They are intently gazing at the cell phone in their hands, perhaps checking a schedule or reading a message. Before them, a sleek silver train rests on the track, its doors poised to open and welcome passengers to the next leg of their travels.
