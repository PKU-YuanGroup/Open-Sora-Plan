A large, clear glass pitcher filled to the brim with golden beer, the frothy head spilling slightly over the edge. An elephant's trunk, textured and wrinkled, is playfully dipped into the pitcher, disrupting the liquid's surface. The pitcher sits on a wooden table, with a few scattered peanuts nearby, hinting at a bar-like setting.
