In the midst of a bustling cityscape, during the golden hour of sunset, stands an enormous trombone that stretches upwards like a unique city monument. Its brass surface is painted with bold sections of red, green, and yellow, mimicking the familiar sequence of a traffic signal. Around its base, people and vehicles move about, creating a dynamic contrast between the stillness of the instrument and the motion of the city life.
