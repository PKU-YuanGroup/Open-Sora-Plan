a spacious room featuring a large painting of the Statue of Liberty prominently displayed on the main wall. Two modern chairs with sleek, silver frames and black cushions are positioned facing the artwork, creating a simple yet elegant seating area. The floor beneath is a polished hardwood, reflecting the soft light that filters into the room from a nearby window.
