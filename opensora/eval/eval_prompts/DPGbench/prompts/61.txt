A modern kitchen featuring a polished granite countertop where a square-shaped stainless steel rice cooker stands conspicuously. The appliance's surface gleams under the natural morning light that filters through the window. Behind it, the kitchen wall is clad in a vibrant orange wallpaper with subtle patterns, adding a dash of color to the culinary space.
