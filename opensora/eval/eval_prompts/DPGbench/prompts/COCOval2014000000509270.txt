A vibrant yellow kite soars high in the sky, its long tail fluttering in the wind. Below it, a diverse array of other kites of various shapes and sizes fill the air, creating a colorful spectacle. The kites dance and dip against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, occasionally crossing paths as they ride the gentle breeze.
