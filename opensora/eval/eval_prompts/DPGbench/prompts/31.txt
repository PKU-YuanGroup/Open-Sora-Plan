An array of freshly baked goods is presented on a rectangular silver tray with a reflective surface. To one side, vibrant sun-yellow lemon tarts, their delicate, flaky pastry crusts cradling a glistening citrus filling, are arranged neatly in a row. Adjacent to them, slightly purple-blueberry muffins, their tops golden brown and dusted with a fine layer of sugar, exhibit a contrasting texture. The pastries are placed against a backdrop of a marbled white countertop, with soft natural light enhancing their appetizing colors.
