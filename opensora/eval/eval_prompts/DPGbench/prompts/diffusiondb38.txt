in the whimsical artwork by Remedios Varo, a boy roams through a cobbled street with a giant yellow and black butterfly on a leash. The butterfly towers over the boy, its wings a complex network of vibrant hues and patterns, contrasting with the dull grays and browns of the surrounding buildings. The boy, dressed in a simple green shirt and brown trousers, looks up in awe at his colossal companion as they proceed on their surreal promenade.
