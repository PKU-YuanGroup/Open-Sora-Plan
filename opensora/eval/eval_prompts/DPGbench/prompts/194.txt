At a playground, there are two colorful plushie toys, fashioned to resemble cheerful little characters, securely riding on the backs of small mechanical sheep. These sheep are on a circular track, endlessly circling beneath the warm glow of an orange sunset that blankets the sky. The surrounding play area is dotted with other equipment, but these plushie toys, with their exaggerated smiles and bright button eyes, stand out against the fading daylight.
