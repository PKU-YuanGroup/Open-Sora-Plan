In the fading light of dusk, three circular targets aglow with bright neon lights hang suspended in the tranquil evening air. Below, a well-worn pair of skating shoes, marked with scuffs and bearing the tale of countless rides, sits abandoned on the weathered wooden slats of an old park bench. Around the bench, the soft glow of nearby street lamps casts a subtle light, creating a gentle contrast with the vivid colors of the floating targets.
