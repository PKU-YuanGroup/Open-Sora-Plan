Under the bright midday light, a sleek glass display shelf within a boutique shop showcases an array of cosmetics. Three lipsticks, each a different shade of pink, red, and burgundy, are aligned meticulously beside a pair of shining black leather shoes, reflecting the overhead lighting. The shoes boast a perfect sheen, hinting at their unworn condition, and they sit adjacent to the lipsticks, adding contrast with their sharp, polished appearance against the soft textures of the makeup.
