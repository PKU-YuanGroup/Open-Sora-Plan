On the cool, silken sands of a deserted beach, a pair of blue sandals lies side by side, their straps glistening gently in the bright moonlight. Next to the sandals, a white protective face mask is placed neatly, its ear loops partially buried in the fine grains of sand. The tranquil nocturnal shoreline stretches far into the distance, with the rhythmic sound of waves creating a peaceful backdrop for the inanimate companions.
