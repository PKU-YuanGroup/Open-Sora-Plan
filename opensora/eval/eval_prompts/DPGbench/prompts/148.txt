A vivid yellow chair with a smooth, plastic texture sits adjacent to a sleek red treadmill in a compact, square-shaped room. The wall behind these pieces of equipment is painted a vibrant turquoise blue, which contrasts sharply with the equipment. The sun shines through a window, illuminating the space at midday, casting soft shadows on the light grey flooring.
