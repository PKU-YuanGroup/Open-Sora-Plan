Two wooden rowboats with a weathered finish are resting side by side on the sandy shore. The boats are empty, with their oars tucked neatly inside, hinting at a recent return from a journey on the water. In the background, the gentle waves of the sea can be seen, with the horizon stretching wide beyond them.
