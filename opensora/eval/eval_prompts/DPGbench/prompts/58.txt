On a stretch of sunlit sidewalk, three identical cylindrical blue parking meters stand in a neat line, each adorned with a digital display and coin slot. Their metallic surfaces gleam intermittently as pedestrians pass by, casting fleeting shadows along the paved walkway. Positioned uniformly, they oversee the adjacent parked cars, quietly awaiting the next round of patrons to deposit their change.
