A close-up view of a canvas where the word 'swirl' is artistically represented with muted pastel colors, such as light pink, baby blue, and soft yellow, mixed elegantly into a white background. The paint appears thick and tactile, giving it a 3D globular texture that seems almost liquid in form. The colors gently intertwine with each other, following the shape of the letters, creating an appealing visual of blending hues.
