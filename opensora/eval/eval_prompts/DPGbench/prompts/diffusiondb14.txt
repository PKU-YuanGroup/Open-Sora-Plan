This is a vibrant, digitally-created watercolor illustration portraying an apocalyptic scene with sharp focus and a smooth finish. The artwork, by James Jean, features Rossdraws' signature style with elements reminiscent of Frank Frazetta's fantasy aesthetics, incorporating Mcbess's bold linework, and infused with the ethereal quality of Sakimichan's enchantments.
