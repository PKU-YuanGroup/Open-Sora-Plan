a highly intricate and vibrant cityscape that reflects a fusion of Moebius's imaginative design and Makoto Shinkai's detailed animation style. The streets are aglow with neon signs in a kaleidoscope of colors, casting reflections on the glossy, rain-slicked pavements. Towering skyscrapers with glowing windows rise towards a starless night sky, as the artwork garners significant attention and praise on ArtStation.
