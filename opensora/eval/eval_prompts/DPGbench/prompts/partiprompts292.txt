A sleek, metallic robot with articulated joints and glowing blue eyes stands holding a large, rectangular sign with bold, colorful letters that spell out "Let's PAINT!" The robot's silver surface reflects the bright lights of the room, and it is positioned next to an array of paint cans in vibrant hues, neatly arranged on a tarp-covered floor. Behind the robot, a blank canvas on an easel awaits the first stroke of creativity.
