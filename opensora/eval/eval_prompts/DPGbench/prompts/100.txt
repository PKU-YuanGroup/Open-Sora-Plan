An immaculate white vanity desk featuring an array of beauty products, among which a soft-bristled cosmetics brush and a sleek black eyeliner pencil are neatly arranged. To the side, a stark and dissonant element, a metallic handgun, lies on the textured surface of a grey concrete floor, creating a jarring juxtaposition against the delicate makeup tools. The vanity itself is positioned against a white wall, illuminated by the natural light streaming in from a nearby window.
