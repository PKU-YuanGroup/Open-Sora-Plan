In the quiet of the evening, a clean, square tissue box with a floral pattern rests atop a folding table beside a pair of modern, metallic washing and drying machines. The laundry room is brightly illuminated, highlighting the soft blue hue of the machines and the sparkling cleanliness of their chrome accents. Along the wall, rows of wooden shelves hold neatly folded towels and various cleaning supplies.
