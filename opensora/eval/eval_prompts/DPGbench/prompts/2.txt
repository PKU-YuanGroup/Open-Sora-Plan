An elegant and modern bathroom featuring a sleek, white rectangular bathtub filled with a froth of soap bubbles. The bathtub rests upon a floor of gray, matte tiles that complement the room's minimalistic design. Against the room's far wall stands a large window that frames the warm, amber hues of a sunset, casting a tranquil glow throughout the space.
