On a clean, organized office desk, there are three red staplers arranged in a precise line. Each stapler has a sleek, rectangular shape with a glossy finish that reflects the overhead lighting. They sit atop a polished, dark brown wooden surface surrounded by scattered paper clips and a few pens, providing a contrast to the vibrant red color of the staplers.
