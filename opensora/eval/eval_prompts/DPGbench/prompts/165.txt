In a modern kitchen, a square, chrome toaster with a sleek finish sits prominently on the marble countertop, its size dwarfing the nearby red vintage rotary telephone, which is placed quaintly on a wooden dining table. The telephone's vibrant red hue contrasts with the neutral tones of the kitchen, and its cord coils gracefully beside it. The polished surfaces of both the toaster and the telephone catch the ambient light, adding a subtle shine to their respective textures.
