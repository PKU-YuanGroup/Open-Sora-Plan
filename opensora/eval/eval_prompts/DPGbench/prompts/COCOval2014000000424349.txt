A chef dressed in a white apron and a tall chef's hat is sliding a freshly topped pizza into a large industrial oven. The professional kitchen is equipped with stainless steel countertops and a variety of cooking utensils hanging from a rack above. The warm glow from the oven illuminates the chef's focused expression as they carefully handle the pizza peel.
