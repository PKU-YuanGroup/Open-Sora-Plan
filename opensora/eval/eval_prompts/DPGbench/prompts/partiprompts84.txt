The book cover features a sleek, modern design with a gradient of blue to purple hues, symbolizing the concept of 'Backpropaganda' by the author I.C. Gradients. The title is emblazoned in bold, white font across the top, with the author's name neatly printed at the bottom. The cover also displays an abstract illustration that hints at the theme of artificial intelligence, with interconnected nodes and lines subtly forming a network pattern.
