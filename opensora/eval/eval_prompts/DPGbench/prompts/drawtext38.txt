a dense forest shrouded in darkness, illuminated only by a single light glowing faintly in the distance. the trees have thick, twisted trunks and are densely packed, their branches creating a canopy that shades the forest floor. clearly visible against this shadowy backdrop is the stark white text "I've come to talk with you again," evoking a sense of solitude and mystery.
