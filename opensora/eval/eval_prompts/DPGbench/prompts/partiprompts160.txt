An abstract cubist painting depicts a chaotic scene where a tornado, composed of angular shark figures, collides with the geometric forms of a skyscraper. The skyscraper is rendered in a series of fragmented, multi-colored planes, suggesting the reflective surfaces of glass and steel. The sharks, with their sharp edges and varying shades of grey and blue, swirl around in a tumultuous dance of destruction within the painting's frame.
