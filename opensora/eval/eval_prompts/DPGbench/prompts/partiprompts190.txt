A bold, white sign with the words 'KEEP OFF THE GRASS' stands prominently next to a lush, green lawn. The sign, with its stark black lettering, is mounted on a metal pole and positioned at the edge of the neatly trimmed grass. Surrounding the lawn are small flowering plants, adding a touch of color to the scene.
