A clear glass filled with vibrant orange juice sits to the right of a white ceramic plate, which cradles two slices of golden-brown toast generously spread with melting butter. The plate and glass are positioned on a light wooden table, with a patterned napkin folded neatly beside them. Sunlight filters through a nearby window, casting a warm glow on the breakfast setup and highlighting the texture of the freshly baked toast.
