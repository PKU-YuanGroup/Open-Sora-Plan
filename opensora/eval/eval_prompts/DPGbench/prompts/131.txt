A spherical tissue dispenser sits flush against the curved edge of a white porcelain sink, creating a harmonious visual continuity. The tissue dispenser, with its polished silver finish, reflects the soft light in the room, contrasting with the sink's matte surface. The basin itself is neatly embedded into a marble countertop, which stretches across the bathroom, punctuated by chrome faucets that gleam under the overhead lighting.
