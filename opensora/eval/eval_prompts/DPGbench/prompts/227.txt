On the soft, warm sand of the beach, a fluffy white rabbit with rounded ears is caught in a curious moment, gently placing its paw on the ribbed surface of a pink scallop shell. The scallop, slightly open, reveals its smooth interior contrasting with its coarse outer texture, while hues of pink and orange from the setting sun reflect off its surface. There's a tranquil ocean backdrop with the gentle ebbing of the tide, and the fading daylight casts a golden glow over the scene, highlighting the rabbit's soft fur and the shell's subtle color.
