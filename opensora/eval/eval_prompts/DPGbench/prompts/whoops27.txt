A large, colorful rooster, with glossy feathers in shades of red, green, and gold, appears to be emerging from a cracked white eggshell. The scene unfolds on a rustic wooden table, with loose straw scattered around the egg's fragments. Against the backdrop, there's a barn door slightly ajar, allowing a sliver of daylight to accentuate the rooster's vibrant plumage.
