a whimsical illustration of a small, white baby daikon radish with rosy cheeks and green shoots atop its head, donning a pink, frilly tutu. It is walking a brown, fluffy dog on a red leash, which looks up at the radish with a playful expression. The background features a simple, pastel-colored path that winds through a grassy field.
