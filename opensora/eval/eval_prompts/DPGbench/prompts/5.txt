An illuminated calculator with a sleek, dark casing and round, raised buttons sits flat on a wooden office table. The sun's fading light gently seeps through the window, casting a warm glow over the calculator's surface and the scattered papers around it. Shadows from nearby objects subtly play across the table, enriching the tranquil setting of a quiet study space.
