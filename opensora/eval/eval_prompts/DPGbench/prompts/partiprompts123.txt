An impressionistic painting depicts a vibrant blue cow standing serenely in a field of delicate white flowers. Adjacent to the cow, there is a robust tree with a canopy of red leaves and branches laden with yellow fruit. The brushstrokes suggest a gentle breeze moving through the scene, and the cow's shadow is cast softly on the green grass beneath it.
