A dusty red pickup truck parked on a gravel path, with a chestnut horse standing calmly to its left, its mane gently blowing in the breeze. On the right side of the truck, two dogs, one with a golden coat and the other with black and white spots, sit attentively. The truck's bed is filled with hay bales, hinting at a day's work on the farm.
