A one-on-one comparison of a woman and her reflection in a large, frameless mirror affixed to a pastel-colored wall. The woman is clad in a sleek black dress and pearl earrings, whereas her reflection dons a vibrant red sundress with a delicate gold necklace. The entire setting is illuminated by natural light filtering in through a nearby window.
