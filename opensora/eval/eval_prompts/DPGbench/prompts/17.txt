A bright red lighter rests atop a polished wooden desk, its surface reflecting the soft overhead lighting. The desk itself boasts a rich and deep mahogany color, free from clutter except for the solitary lighter. Off to the side of the desk stands a green potted plant, adding a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise methodical arrangement.
