A grand wall within a royal castle, adorned with two large, ornate frames. The painting on the left showcases a regal raccoon king, depicted in vibrant oil colors with meticulous attention to his fur and crown. Opposite to it, the right painting is an equally detailed portrayal of the royal raccoon queen, her gaze dignified and attire resplendent. At the foot of these majestic artworks, a small, fluffy dog with a curious expression stands, clutching a handwritten sign in its mouth that pleads, "plz conserve," adding a touch of whimsy to the stately scene.
