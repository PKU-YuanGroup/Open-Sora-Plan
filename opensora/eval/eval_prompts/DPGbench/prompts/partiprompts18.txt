A close-up image captures a furry wombat with a curious expression, donning a bright red backpack snugly fitted on its back. The adorable marsupial stands on its hind legs, with both arms raised in a triumphant or playful gesture. In the distance, the iconic Mount Rushmore serves as a majestic backdrop, with the carved faces of the four presidents etched into the mountainside.
