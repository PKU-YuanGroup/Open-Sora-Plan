In a room with beige carpeting, an individual is in the midst of a sit-up exercise, positioned on the floor with their body slightly raised. Their left hand is pressed against their cheek to support their head, while their left leg is bent inward, creating an angle at the knee. The space around them is sparse, and to their side, a folded yoga mat and a pair of dumbbells lay within reach.
