A vibrant graffiti artwork displaying the word "WOMBAT" in bold, multicolored letters, each character outlined in black to create a striking contrast against the stark white wall. The letters are embellished with various shades of blue, green, red, and yellow, with dramatic splashes of paint scattered around the composition. The texture of the dripping paint adds a dynamic and tactile quality to the mural.
