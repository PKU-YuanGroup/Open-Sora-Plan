A single silver coin glistens as it miraculously floats on the surface of a clear, blue body of water. Sunlight reflects off the coin's smooth, metallic texture, creating a shimmering effect on the surrounding water. Nearby, the gentle ripples in the water create a subtle movement that contrasts with the stillness of the coin.
