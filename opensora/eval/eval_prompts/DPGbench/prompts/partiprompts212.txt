An old red pickup truck, its body covered in patches of rust, sits abandoned in an open field. The truck's white doors stand in stark contrast to the faded red paint, and the windshield is shattered, with spiderweb cracks running across the glass. The vehicle's bed is empty, and the tires are worn, hinting at many years of service and neglect.
