A surreal and unlikely scene where the iconic Millennium Wheel, with its towering white and blue structure, stands adjacent to the green-hued Statue of Liberty, which raises its torch high into the sky. In the background, the intricate spires of the Sagrada Familia church rise majestically, showcasing its unique architectural blend of Gothic and Art Nouveau styles. The three landmarks are juxtaposed in a way that defies their geographical realities, creating a fantastical skyline.
