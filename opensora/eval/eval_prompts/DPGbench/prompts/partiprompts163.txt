a vivid and bizarre oil painting by Salvador Dal√≠ that depicts a cat with exaggerated features engaged in a game of checkers. The checkerboard is floating in an undefined space, with pieces that seem to melt over the edges. The background swirls with a mix of warm and cool colors, adding to the dream-like quality of the scene.
