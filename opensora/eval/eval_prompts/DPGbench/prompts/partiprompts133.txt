An anthropomorphic beaver, exuding an air of sophistication, stands upright beside a towering pile of books in a library setting. The beaver is adorned with a pair of round, wire-rimmed glasses perched on its nose, a neatly buttoned vest, and a vibrant necktie featuring an array of geometric patterns. The surrounding shelves are filled with an assortment of leather-bound and hardcover books, some with gold lettering on their spines, creating a backdrop of literary abundance.
