An anime-style illustration depicts a whimsical scene where a kangaroo, rendered in vibrant shades of brown and tan, clutches a rectangular sign with the words "Starry Night" scrawled across it in bold, whimsical lettering. The kangaroo is seated comfortably in front of the iconic Sydney Opera House, its distinctive white sail-like structures contrasting sharply with the deep blue of the night sky. To the kangaroo's side, the Eiffel Tower looms, its iron lattice silhouette adding to the surreal composition. Above, the sky is alive with dynamic swirls of blue and bursts of radiant yellow stars, capturing the essence of a dreamlike cosmic event.
