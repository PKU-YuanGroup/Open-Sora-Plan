a massive tornado with a swirling gray funnel cloud, tearing through the landscape with debris flying around its base. At the top of the vortex, a small wooden house, with its windows shattered and roof partially torn off, is being lifted into the air. The tornado is moving across an open field, and the sky above is a menacing shade of dark gray.
