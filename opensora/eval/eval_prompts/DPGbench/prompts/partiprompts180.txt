A vibrant watercolor mural depicting a group of foxes playing jazz instruments adorns a large wall on a bustling city street. The foxes are painted in various shades of orange and red, with one playing a saxophone and another on the drums, set against a backdrop of colorful musical notes. The wall itself is part of a row of buildings, with pedestrians passing by and occasionally stopping to admire the artwork.
