a grand piano, its glossy black surface partially obscured by the warm glow of multicolored Christmas lights draped across it. The piano stands in a room with hardwood floors and a high ceiling, giving it an elegant presence. Nearby, a green potted plant adds a touch of life to the scene, contrasting with the piano's ebony finish.
