Three cows, a mix of white and brown patches, are lazily grazing in an expansive meadow under the soft glow of the afternoon sun. Before them, stands a large blackboard, planted firmly in the grass, creating a striking contrast with the surrounding lush greenery. Above them, a few wispy clouds are scattered in the otherwise clear blue sky.
