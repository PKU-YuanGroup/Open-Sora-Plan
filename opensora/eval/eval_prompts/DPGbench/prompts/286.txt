Under the soft hues of twilight, a standard black stapler can be seen next to a robust, orange and metallic chainsaw. Both items are cast in the gentle light, creating elongated shadows on the ground beneath them. The textures are distinctly different â€“ the stapler's smooth, plastic finish contrasts sharply with the rugged, seemingly worn appearance of the chainsaw. They sit unusually together on a patch of grass still holding onto the day's warmth.
