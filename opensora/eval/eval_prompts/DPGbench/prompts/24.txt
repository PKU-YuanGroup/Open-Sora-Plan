Five red hockey sticks, each with a slender shape and a worn texture from frequent use, are propped against the frosty rink's white boards. The sky above casts a dim, featureless gray light over the area, accentuating the early morning stillness. On the icy surface of the rink, illuminated by the ambient outdoor lighting, the sticks' shadows form elongated silhouettes, showcasing their readiness for the day's practice.
