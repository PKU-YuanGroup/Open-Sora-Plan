An outdoor scene featuring a textured gravel driveway where a bright orange basketball rests to the left of two black and white soccer balls. The driveway is bordered by a patch of green grass, and the balls cast soft shadows on the ground due to the overhead sunlight. In the background, there is a glimpse of a wooden fence that marks the boundary of the property.
