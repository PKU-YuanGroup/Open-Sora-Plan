A figure can be seen balancing on both feet, their torso tilted sharply to the left, creating a dynamic angle. Their arms are stretched out on either side of their body for balance, with each elbow forming a precise 90-degree bend. The person may seem to be mid-exercise or in the middle of a stretching routine, possibly wearing comfortable athletic attire suitable for the activity.
