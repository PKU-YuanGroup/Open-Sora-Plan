A photorealistic depiction of a transformation from a furry caterpillar to a demonic figure with lifelike textures and detail. The caterpillar's body is portrayed with soft, delicate hairs transitioning into a glistening, wet pupa stage. The final form emerges as a horror-inducing demon with a screaming visage, sharp fangs, and red, slimy hands that are deformed yet eerily precise in their 3-dimensional rendering.
