In a grassy field stands a cow, its fur a patchwork of black and white, with a bright yellow megaphone attached to its red collar. The grass around its hooves is a lush green, and in the background, a wooden fence can be seen, stretching into the distance. The cow's expression is one of mild curiosity as it gazes off into the horizon, the megaphone positioned as if ready to amplify the cow's next "moo".
