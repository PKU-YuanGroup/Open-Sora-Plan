A skier, clad in a bright yellow snowsuit that stands out against the white snow, swiftly descends a snowy slope. A cloud of freshly stirred powder trails behind them, evidence of an exhilarating jump just taken. In their gloved hands, they firmly grip two black ski poles that cut through the powdery snow with each focused movement. The vast expanse of the mountain can be seen around them, adorned with snow-laden conifers and the distant peaks shrouded in mist.
