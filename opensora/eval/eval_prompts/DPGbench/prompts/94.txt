Two bright red skiboards are propped up against the rugged bark of a tall pine tree, their bindings reflecting the sunlight that filters through the branches. Next to them, a pair of black skating shoes with neon green laces sits neatly on the freshly fallen snow. The surrounding area is quiet and untouched, suggesting an anticipation for an exhilarating afternoon of winter sports activities.
