A spacious study room featuring a large rectangular oak desk dominated by a scarlet barbell used as an unconventional paperweight. The desk surface is scattered with papers, books, and a sleek, silver laptop. Flanking the desk are tall bookshelves filled with an array of books, and the sunlight filters through a large window, illuminating the space with natural light.
