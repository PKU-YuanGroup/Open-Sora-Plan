Eight vibrant green beach balls, each with a glossy texture, are randomly scattered across the golden sand that is patterned with the alternating shades of sunlight and shadow. Nearby, gentle waves lap at the shoreline, creating a rhythmic sound that complements the serene beachscape. The balls cast soft shadows on the sand, evidencing the bright midday sun overhead.
