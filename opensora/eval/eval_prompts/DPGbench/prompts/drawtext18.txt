an animated image depicting a green turtle with a perplexed expression on its face. The turtle is standing upright on two legs and has a large, transparent thought bubble above its head, filled with the paradoxical question, 'what if there was no such thing as a thought bubble?' surrounding the turtle, there are simplistic drawings of grass and flowers, emphasizing the cartoonish nature of the image.
