A classic Greek statue carved from white marble, depicting a muscular man with a stern expression as he gently comforts a cat with an unusually large head. The cat, also sculpted from marble, seems to be at ease in the man's strong arms. The statue stands on a stone pedestal, and the intricate details of the man's curly hair and the cat's fur texture are visible, highlighting the sculptor's skilled craftsmanship.
