An intricate culinary creation, a map of the United States crafted entirely out of assorted sushi pieces, is displayed on a large, round white plate. The plate sits on a dark wooden table, accompanied by a tall glass of red wine to its right, casting a slight shadow on the polished surface. Each state is represented by a different type of sushi, offering a colorful and textured mosaic of rice, seaweed, and various fish.
