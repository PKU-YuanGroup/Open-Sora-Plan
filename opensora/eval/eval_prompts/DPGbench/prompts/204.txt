In the quiet glow of the afternoon sun, a bright yellow helmet and a dusty green backpack are spotted perched on the roof of a silver SUV. The helmet, with minor scuff marks and a dark visor, sits slightly askew, as if hastily placed there. The backpack, partially unzipped with a water bottle peeking out, leans against the vehicle's black roof rack, hinting at a recent adventure or a pause in a journey.
