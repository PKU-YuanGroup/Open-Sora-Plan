        "the changing sunlight casts shifting shadows that highlight the rugged textures of the cliff and the surrounding calm sea. "
        "The water gently laps at the rock base and the greenery that clings to the top of the cliff, "
        "and the scene gives a sense of peaceful isolation at the fringes of the ocean. "

        "The balloons are scattered across the sky, some closer to the viewer, "

        "Below, the mountainous terrain is blanketed in a thick layer of snow, "
